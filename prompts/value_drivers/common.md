# Common Rules for Value Driver Extraction

## What is Wispr Flow?

Wispr Flow is a voice dictation app that lets users write by speaking instead of typing.

## What are Value Drivers?

Value drivers are the **reasons WHY users love the product** - the benefits, advantages, and positive outcomes they experience.

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
- **Use cases** = WHAT users do with Wispr (emails, coding, notes)
- **Value drivers** = WHY users love Wispr (speed, accuracy, convenience)

## Examples of Value Drivers

- "It's 4x faster than typing" → Speed/efficiency
- "The transcription is incredibly accurate" → Accuracy
- "It automatically formats my text perfectly" → Smart formatting
- "I can finally write without wrist pain" → Physical relief
- "It works in every app" → Universal compatibility
- "I sound more professional in emails" → Better output quality
- "I can capture ideas before I forget them" → Idea capture
- "It understands what I mean, not just what I say" → Intent understanding
- "No more typos" → Error reduction
- "It learns my vocabulary" → Personalization

## What is NOT a Value Driver

- Use cases: "I use it for emails" (that's WHAT, not WHY)
- Feature descriptions without benefit: "It has a dictionary feature"
- Generic praise without specifics: "It's great", "I love it"
- Comparisons without benefit stated: "Better than Siri"

## Extraction Rules

1. Extract the **specific benefit or positive outcome** the user experiences
2. Each value driver should be a clear, standalone statement of value
3. Include the exact quote that supports the value driver
4. Keep value driver descriptions concise (5-15 words)
5. Focus on the BENEFIT to the user, not just feature names
6. Only extract from genuinely positive statements (not sarcasm or complaints)
