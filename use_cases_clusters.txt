   Use_Case: Summarizing long documents
   Quote: "summarizing long documents"
   Full Review: "Such a nice improvement to regular speech-to-text.

I'm writing this using the app! I'll be honest that I'm pretty skeptical of a lot of AI tools, but there are certain things, such as summarizing long documents, and in this case, getting closer to my real intent when trying to dictate something, that are really great uses for AI. I love the accurate punctuation and its patience when I stop or fumble with my thinking out loud."

   Use_Case: Using consistently
   Quote: "I use it constantly"
   Full Review: "Not ready for iPad

I adore Wispr Flow on my PC. I use it constantly. But as a iPad user WisprFlow for iOS is useless. Full of bugs and no ability to adapt to the different UI—not even horizontal configuration. Wait for a dedicated iPad version. I haven’t tried it on iPhone, so can’t comment on that."

   Use_Case: Answering texts
   Quote: "answering text"
   Full Review: "Easy and fun

Flow made answering text, email, and social media a snap to answer. No more heads down on a keyboard. I dictate a quick answer, it fixes what I dictated so it makes sense, then I hit send. So quick and easy."

Wispr Flow takes talk-to-text to a whole new level. You can just brain dump and it does such an amazing job at turning your rambling into something coherent. I love that it is app-agnostic, which lets me use it everywhere. Truly one of my most used apps at this point."

This app is working great for me. I was searching for an app that would help me write better and understand my speech patterns, and I think I hit the jackpot. This app is amazing. You can use it in almost any writing app like Messages, Notes, Mail, and Instagram. Highly recommend this app if you are looking to improve your writing."

   Use_Case: Transcribing thoughts
   Quote: "having it transcribe into an understandable review"
   Full Review: "Absolute Game Changer

Hopefully this review will serve as reason enough to trust in Wispr Flow. This entire review was written by me just rambling into Wispr Flow and having it transcribe into an understandable review for you guys. Literally I've seen so many YouTubers use this and I thought, "Let's give it a try," and was hooked immediately. I use it pretty much across the board. The only recommendation I can make for the team is to update the Wispr Flow keyboard UI to be up-to-date with the new iOS 26 keyboard because Apple changed the look of the keyboard. The Wispr Flow keyboard doesn't look native anymore like I would hope to see. Other than this tiny little suggestion, everything about this app is fantastic."

   Quote: "have the AI clean up what I mean"

It's absolutely unbelievable how effective the transcription technology is at capturing both the format intent and specific language I use. It's so much faster than typing. I can just pause at certain parts of a sentence. It'll insert paragraphs automatically. It's so valuable to be able to just talk for a little bit and have the AI clean up what I mean."

   Full Review: "Relief!

I recently started developing carpal tunnel in my left hand and have been trying to give it a break. When I came across Wispr Flow, I was super happy because now I can just dictate. One thing I will say that Wispr Flow does better than any other literal dictation app is that it intelligently knows when you're giving a list or any other kind of expression where it just knows how to put it all together."

I have been screaming from the rooftops about how good this app is. I basically describe it as SIRI, but that actually works… and for your desktop.

I had to type out an email the other day because there were a bunch of people in the room, and I realized how fast I've gotten used to dictating almost everything. I'm never going back to typing. So 2024."

I've only been using Wispr Flow for a day, and I'm already hooked. I can literally dictate into any text box in any app, and it just works. Doesn't matter if I'm on my laptop or my phone. Everything syncs, and all my messages show up in the Wispr app. Feels kind of magical. If I want to find something I dictate it, I don't have to remember which app I was in. I just open Wispr, and it's all there. Simple, useful. Love it! 🚀"

I had played around with various speech to text efforts over the years, but never had the patience needed to “train” the software.

But I had MONTHS of regular, ongoing documents, podcasts, books to write, more expected output the next 2 years, then any 10 year period before, and I loath typing/texting.

10 minutes after setup, natural speech, wrote a 10 page assessment of 3 AI programs. I am now 80% keyboard free on my iPhone and MacBook Pro (in all Apps and Freeform commenting on various Social Media platforms) and expect to be 98% keyboard-less very soon.

   Full Post: "Every teammate you invite now gets a 14-day Flow Pro trial, even if they’ve already tried it before Hey everyone, we’ve just rolled out one of our biggest updates to how teams use Wispr Flow.

# Before

Flow Pro was only available for individual users, and teams had to upgrade to a separate **Flow Teams** plan.

That plan required:

* Upfront payment to add new members
* A minimum of 3 seats
* No free trials for teammates

# Now

That’s changing.

**Flow Pro now works for both individuals and teams**, with: 

* **Free 14-day trials for every invited teammate,** even if they’ve already done an individual trial
* **No upfront payments** or seat minimums required

And we'll still have: 

* **Centralized billing and admin controls**, with a revamped admin portal 
* **Shared Snippets and Dictionary** for consistent templates and terminology across your team

The goal is to make it risk-free to bring your whole team onto Flow, try the full Pro experience together, and upgrade only once you’re ready.

# For Larger Teams

**Flow Enterprise** still covers everything for organizations that need stricter security or compliance:

* SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance
* Enforced HIPAA compliance and Zero Data Retention
* SSO/SAML integration
* Bulk pricing options

You can start small on Flow Pro and upgrade to Enterprise seamlessly when you need those controls.

   Full Post: "Personalized Style: Make Flow sound more like you! Before, Wispr Flow automatically formatted your text differently depending on whether you were in an email app or a messaging app. In **emails**, Flow used full punctuation, capitalization, and line breaks to look polished. In **messaging apps**, Flow made things a bit lighter and more casual.

That worked fine for most people, but it didn’t always reflect your personal writing style.

Now with **Personalized Style**, you now decide how Flow formats your text based on the type of app, so you always sound like *you*.

Choose your preferred formatting for each type of app:

* **Personal messaging apps** (iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram)
* **Work messaging apps** (Slack, Teams)
* **Email apps** (Gmail, Outlook, Superhuman)
* **Other apps** (Docs, Notes, ChatGPT, etc.)

Depending on the app category, you’ll be able to choose from **Very Casual, Casual, Excited, or Formal.** Flow will automatically apply your chosen **punctuation** and **capitalization** whenever you dictate. However, your words stay yours: Flow won't alter your grammar, phrasing, or word choice.

Flow isn’t really built for recording meetings. It’s optimized for shorter (think &lt;5 min) bursts of speech, like writing follow-ups, jotting down thoughts, or replying to messages. 

Meeting recorders work differently. They handle long, continuous audio streams with significant lag before you get a full transcript. Flow transcribes your words almost immediately, and in any text box where you type. 

So we're less of a "meeting recorder" and more of a "voice keyboard" if that makes sense!"

   Use_Case: Freeing local storage
   Quote: "Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage."
   Full Post: "[Feature Request] Cloud Sync for Transcription History Across Devices Hey Wispr Flow team and community!

I’d love to see cloud sync functionality added for our transcription history. Right now, each device stores everything locally, and I think having our transcripts synced across all devices would be a game-changer.

**Why this would be useful:**

1. **Access history anywhere** - Being able to view and search through my transcription history on my phone, computer, or any device where I use Wispr Flow would be incredibly convenient.
2. **Storage concerns** - Local storage is becoming a real issue. My phone already has over 1GB of documents just for the app, and I can’t even imagine how much my computer has accumulated. Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage.
2. **Backup and peace of mind** - If something happens to one device, I wouldn’t lose all my transcription history.

Of course, I understand this will be implemented as an optional feature that users can opt into if they’re comfortable sharing their transcription data and history with Wispr. That way, users who prioritize privacy can continue using local-only storage while those of us who want the convenience can take advantage of cloud sync.

Would love to hear if others are experiencing similar storage issues or would find this useful!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

Thankfully, they always reload, but it's a bit of a pain when this fails. I'm just wondering and hoping if and when this might be potentially fixed?

   Full Post: "I agree. This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. 

The simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. 

However, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. 

This app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well."

I did a deep dive into Wispr Flow's network traffic and their privacy policy claims are an absolute lie. I've heard reports that they are storing user screenshots and sending massive amounts of telemetry data back to their servers without proper anonymization.

They claim to be "fully compliant" with all the major privacy regulations, but their backend behavior is incredibly sketchy. 
Why does a dictation app need to send a screenshot of my desktop? What are they doing with the raw audio of my private conversations, client calls, and personal notes?

It's a massive security and privacy risk. I immediately uninstalled it and revoked all permissions. I would not trust this company with a grocery list, let alone my professional and personal data. DO NOT USE THIS APP."

   Full Post: "My review of Wispr Flow and Aqua Voice dictation has single handedly 2Xed my productivity over the last month! So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.

I've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.

**My Wispr Flow Review**

**Pros**

* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.
* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.
* Fairly accurate

**Cons**

* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in "casual voice".
* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.
* Often misses the first word of a sentence.
* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.

**My Aqua Voice Review**

**Pros**

* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.
* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. 

**Cons**

* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.
* Same first-word bug as Wispr.
* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.

Hope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?"

   Use_Case: Communicating with ChatGPT
   Quote: "especially with ChatGPT"
   Full Review: "Wow, game changer! Greatest dictation app so far invented.

I use dictation as many people do because it is so much faster than texting. But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. 

This app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived. I used this for 5 minutes before I was like, "this is just going to be part of my life now. It's that good." You see what it did there? It added quotes automatically. Incredible."

I started off trying this app on iOS as a means to talk to various AIs and reply to emails more quickly. I found that it's absolutely amazing how fast it is and how seamlessly it corrects your spelling and punctuation etc. Unlike the iOS built-in app.

The magic is really once you get it working on your work computer (if your work will allow it), your home computer, and your iPad. Now I can hit the Ctrl and Alt keys on any Windows app. If you pay for the full subscription here, they'll let you run it on your other computers, although you may have some issues with authentication.

   Use_Case: Prompting ChatGPT
   Quote: "* **Other apps** (Docs, Notes, ChatGPT, etc.)"
   Full Post: "Personalized Style: Make Flow sound more like you! Before, Wispr Flow automatically formatted your text differently depending on whether you were in an email app or a messaging app. In **emails**, Flow used full punctuation, capitalization, and line breaks to look polished. In **messaging apps**, Flow made things a bit lighter and more casual.

That worked fine for most people, but it didn’t always reflect your personal writing style.

Now with **Personalized Style**, you now decide how Flow formats your text based on the type of app, so you always sound like *you*.

Choose your preferred formatting for each type of app:

* **Personal messaging apps** (iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram)
* **Work messaging apps** (Slack, Teams)
* **Email apps** (Gmail, Outlook, Superhuman)
* **Other apps** (Docs, Notes, ChatGPT, etc.)

Depending on the app category, you’ll be able to choose from **Very Casual, Casual, Excited, or Formal.** Flow will automatically apply your chosen **punctuation** and **capitalization** whenever you dictate. However, your words stay yours: Flow won't alter your grammar, phrasing, or word choice.

   Full Post: "Wispr Flow with wireless mic and Mac in clamshell mode. I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.

However, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.

I was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.

This is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?

I really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.

Any tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?

I'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...

Hence, I am building a voice AI management companion to help individuals become the best versions of themselves. I started with using chat GPT's Whisper - 1 model. This was a disaster. 

I then one day had an idea and epiphany really to start relying on Wispr Flow entirely. My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. 

Since switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application. So does Wispr Flow have an API similar to Deepgram or OpenAI?"

   Use_Case: Writing AI prompts
   Quote: "write detailed AI prompts"
   Full Post: "Introducing r/WisprFlow. Let's make Flow better together! Hey everyone!

I’m Victoria with Wispr Flow. We make voice-to-text that’s fast, accurate, secure, and works on all your apps (Gmail, Slack, ChatGPT, Notion, Cursor). We want to remove the hassle of typing so you can answer emails, write detailed AI prompts, or brain dump ideas as naturally as talking to a friend. 

I started this subreddit because I wanted to create a space where Flow isn’t just “our product,” but something we build alongside the people who rely on it every day. Think of this as a two-way dialogue: we’ll share what we’re building, and you’ll share what’s working, what’s broken, and what you wish existed. 

Here’s some of what you’ll see here:

* Product updates (the good stuff, not just marketing fluff) 
* Guides &amp; workflow breakdowns (for coding, journaling, PRDs, brain-dumps, you name it)
* Security deep dives (what Zero Data Retention, SOC 2, and HIPAA actually mean for you)
* Feature request threads (where your voice actually matters) 
* Community productivity challenges (with cool prizes!) 
* Job postings (we’re hiring across engineering, marketing, recruiting, and design) 

We’re rooting for your success with Flow and hopefully, you’ll root for ours too. But more than that: help us make this space useful for you!

Excited to get this rolling with you all!

– Victoria, Product Marketing Lead at Wispr"

   Full Review: "GOAT

It's absolutely unbelievable how effective the transcription technology is at capturing both the format intent and specific language I use. It's so much faster than typing. I can just pause at certain parts of a sentence. It'll insert paragraphs automatically. It's so valuable to be able to just talk for a little bit and have the AI clean up what I mean."

   Full Review: "I used to be extremely skeptical of voice-to-text. I type so fast, and I was used to all the options being extremely inaccurate. Wispr Flow changed everything, and I'm a believer now. No matter how fast you type, it's a total gamechanger for prompting ChatGPT with more context or answering texts while walking. They also recently added snippets, which let me just say a command instead of typing or copying + pasting the same things over and over."

   Use_Case: Using shared templates
   Quote: "Shared Snippets and Dictionary for consistent templates and terminology across your team"
   Full Post: "Every teammate you invite now gets a 14-day Flow Pro trial, even if they’ve already tried it before Hey everyone, we’ve just rolled out one of our biggest updates to how teams use Wispr Flow.

# Before

Flow Pro was only available for individual users, and teams had to upgrade to a separate **Flow Teams** plan.

That plan required:

* Upfront payment to add new members
* A minimum of 3 seats
* No free trials for teammates

# Now

That’s changing.

**Flow Pro now works for both individuals and teams**, with: 

* **Free 14-day trials for every invited teammate,** even if they’ve already done an individual trial
* **No upfront payments** or seat minimums required

And we'll still have: 

* **Centralized billing and admin controls**, with a revamped admin portal 
* **Shared Snippets and Dictionary** for consistent templates and terminology across your team

The goal is to make it risk-free to bring your whole team onto Flow, try the full Pro experience together, and upgrade only once you’re ready.

# For Larger Teams

**Flow Enterprise** still covers everything for organizations that need stricter security or compliance:

* SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance
* Enforced HIPAA compliance and Zero Data Retention
* SSO/SAML integration
* Bulk pricing options

You can start small on Flow Pro and upgrade to Enterprise seamlessly when you need those controls.

   Use_Case: Vibe coding
   Quote: "subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x"
   Full Post: "Wispr Flow with wireless mic and Mac in clamshell mode. I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.

However, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.

I was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.

This is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?

I really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.

Any tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?

I'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...

UPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with."

You better mention this in your docs because **I was about to cancel my subscription until the wireless mic idea crossed my mind** and I am happy it did, now I am giving away my link to lots of friends and encouraging them to try it, its simply awesome!

And also ordered another 3 wireless mic for my team mates to code with, its a game changer!

   Full Post: "I know what you mean, and I consider doing that, but that implies you are duplicating everything. Like creating 10 copies of the same link. 

One thing that would be amazing is if you could either create multiple trigger phrases for the same result (different types of phrases that will bring up the same link or content). 

Or an even better idea would be to add a shortcut menu where you finish talking and then press a button to show you all the snippets. You just select the one you want, and it inserts it in line. Bonus points if you can organize them by folders or tags or something. 

I know that this is kind of beyond the scope of Wispr Flow because it's a voice app, but it would make it so much easier to recall and bring up different snippets. 

One common use case that I have is not just for coaching links, but for example, I answer a lot of people's questions online, and many times the answer to a question involves a link to one of my YouTube videos. So I have to go now and look up the video, copy the share link, and then paste it in my response. It would be amazing if I could simply say "my video on such-and-such topic" and it brings up that URL automatically. 

Maybe I am going into rag territory here. This is one idea that I mentioned to you on Twitter a while ago. For example, when I mention in my speech something about coaching link or whatever, something that might match one of my snippets, at the end of dictation it would pop up a menu with suggested snippets to include based on the keywords that I mentioned."

We're really sorry about the delay in support. We recently transitioned customer support systems, and that’s unfortunately slowed us down on responses. The good news is that we're actively hiring and training new support folks, so we will be much more responsive going forward! 

I'm actually a huge fan of Every's newsletter, but I do want to highlight some features that set us apart from Monologue: 

* Cross-platform availability: we're available on Mac, Windows, and iPhone while Monologue is just on Mac. 
* Enterprise-grade security: SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance 
* Features for developers: If you're a developer or vibe coder, you'll notice that Flow actually understands your code. In Cursor and Windsurf, you can even tag files. 
* [Snippets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WisprFlow/comments/1nimgwg/lpt_tired_of_retyping_the_same_things_try/): You can create custom voice shortcuts for things like booking links or outreach templates instead of typing them over and over. 

**And as someone who's been around since the early days, I'd love to hear any feedback you might have on how we can make both our product and our community better!**"

   Use_Case: Improving accessibility for disabled users
   Quote: "I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is life-changing"
   Full Review: "Wow, game changer! Greatest dictation app so far invented.

I use dictation as many people do because it is so much faster than texting. But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. 

This app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived. I used this for 5 minutes before I was like, "this is just going to be part of my life now. It's that good." You see what it did there? It added quotes automatically. Incredible."

I'm using the app everywhere, including here to write this review. This tool has saved so much time as I spend on the road, driving to and from appointments. I have now truly become hands-free. I work in the real estate industry, and I can honestly say that this app would help realtors everywhere. Aside from that, I even use it to write my Yelp reviews and notes for the grocery store, using it in ChatGPT, text messages, writing emails - you name it. So much less time spent with my thumbs on my phone just using my voice. Definitely worth every penny."

   Quote: "juggling tasks"
   Full Review: "5-Star Review: Wispr Flow is the Best Voice-to-Text App I’ve Used

Wispr Flow has completely changed how I capture ideas and get work done. It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.

The convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.

I’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.

If you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have. It just works—and it works really well."

It took a little bit of getting used to, but once I got over the initial friction, my God, Flow for iOS has changed my life. 

I now use it for my 20-minute walks to and from work to respond to my entire inbox. I show up to the office and I don't have to get through a humongous backlog of messages anymore. It just turns everything into a well-formatted, structured email and saves me so much time. Genuinely life-changing ❤️

   Full Post: "Every teammate you invite now gets a 14-day Flow Pro trial, even if they’ve already tried it before Hey everyone, we’ve just rolled out one of our biggest updates to how teams use Wispr Flow.

# Before

Flow Pro was only available for individual users, and teams had to upgrade to a separate **Flow Teams** plan.

That plan required:

* Upfront payment to add new members
* A minimum of 3 seats
* No free trials for teammates

# Now

That’s changing.

**Flow Pro now works for both individuals and teams**, with: 

* **Free 14-day trials for every invited teammate,** even if they’ve already done an individual trial
* **No upfront payments** or seat minimums required

And we'll still have: 

* **Centralized billing and admin controls**, with a revamped admin portal 
* **Shared Snippets and Dictionary** for consistent templates and terminology across your team

The goal is to make it risk-free to bring your whole team onto Flow, try the full Pro experience together, and upgrade only once you’re ready.

# For Larger Teams

**Flow Enterprise** still covers everything for organizations that need stricter security or compliance:

* SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance
* Enforced HIPAA compliance and Zero Data Retention
* SSO/SAML integration
* Bulk pricing options

You can start small on Flow Pro and upgrade to Enterprise seamlessly when you need those controls.

   Full Post: "Hey  u/Diligent_Rope3144, thanks a ton for this super clear write-up.

You’re right that the **toggle/mic state mismatch** is a bug. The toggle should always reflect the true mic status. We’ll make sure that gets fixed in an upcoming update.

To better understand the rest of your workflow (and make sure we’re improving the right thing), could you share a bit more context?

* What’s your main reason for turning Flow on from the **in-app toggle** instead of the **keyboard mic**?
* When you do that, are you usually trying to keep Flow running in the **background** (e.g., for longer dictation), or just to make it faster to re-activate?
* How often do you use the “Immediately turn off” setting vs other timeouts?

We’re exploring whether the toggle should override that “immediate turn-off” behavior, or whether it makes more sense to clarify what it does in the UI. Your input will help!"

Hey, thanks for the thoughtful response — really appreciate you taking the time to dig into this!

To answer your questions and clarify what I’m hoping for:

1. Why I turn Flow on from the in-app toggle:
I have Wispr Flow set to immediately turn off after each message. That means I have to manually tap “Start Flow” every single time I want to speak, which quickly becomes annoying and time-consuming. Turning Flow on from the in-app toggle is my way of trying to keep it active so I don’t have to keep restarting it.

2. What I want it to do:
When I manually toggle Flow on, I expect it to stay active until I either turn it off myself or close the app — regardless of the “immediately turn off” setting. Essentially, the toggle should act as a manual override that keeps Flow running continuously.

So in short:
	•	The toggle should override the “immediate turn off” setting.
	•	Once turned on, Flow should stay active until I manually stop it."

Has anyone found a solution? Multitouch also allows running **bash commands**, in case WisprFlow supports that…

Hence, I am building a voice AI management companion to help individuals become the best versions of themselves. I started with using chat GPT's Whisper - 1 model. This was a disaster. 

I then one day had an idea and epiphany really to start relying on Wispr Flow entirely. My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. 

Since switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application.

   Full Post: "About Wispr Flow’s iOS keyboard I’ve been a Wispr Flow user for a few months now. On Mac, it works beautifully and has become part of my daily workflow. But on iOS, I keep running into issues that I can’t quite wrap my head around.

1. **Default keyboard problem** I’ve already dragged Wispr Flow to the top of my iOS keyboard list (so it should technically be the default), but whenever I switch to a new app, I still have to manually bring it up. It feels clunky. From what I understand, it might be because Wispr Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard—it only has a number pad and a mic button. But if that’s the case… why not just make it a full keyboard? Spokenly, for example, doesn’t run into this exact issue (though it has other problems, like being unusable in Safari and some native iOS apps).
2. **Background permissions** Another hurdle is that I need to constantly jump back into the app to re-enable mic access, especially when switching input devices (like putting on headphones). This breaks the flow and makes quick capture harder than it should be.

These don’t *seem* like unsolvable problems, so I’m wondering—am I missing something here?"

We really appreciate you taking the time to share this, and for being a daily Flow user 🙏. You’re right, these are some limitations on iOS today. Our iOS app is newer than desktop, and we’re actively working to smooth out these rough edges

**On the default keyboard issue:**

You’re right — third-party keyboards like Flow, Grammarly, or Gboard can’t override Apple’s default behavior. Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard yet; it’s optimized for quick capture with the mic and number pad, then hands you back to Apple’s keyboard for autocorrect and swipe typing. That said, building a full letter keyboard *is* on our roadmap once our iOS/ML team grows. (And if you know great engineers: we’re hiring 😉).

→ Full article here: [Default Keyboard Not Sticking](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/8540739176-default-keyboard-not-sticking)



**On the mic resetting when you switch devices:**

This comes down to iOS privacy rules. Apple doesn’t let third-party keyboards auto-re-grant mic access when headphones or input devices change, so Flow needs you to reopen the app. The best workaround we’ve found is setting up a dictation shortcut mapped to your Action Button or Back Tap. That way you can toggle Flow without switching apps.

The app constantly glitches. One minute it works, the next it freezes or disconnects for no reason. I've had it randomly stop during important notes, and sometimes it says it can't connect even though my WiFi is fine.

Also, it seems to be a really clunky electron app. It's always taking up a massive chunk of my computer's memory and slows everything down. It's extremely resource-intensive, especially given the fact that it's always going to be on in the background.

I've requested for support like a million times, but no one ever responds. I've given up on the product for the past couple of weeks. Recently, I've been looking and exploring some new ones.

I still really like the idea behind it, so I’m looking for something that actually works. Here are some better options I’ve found. When researching these, I specifically only looked for the ones that were built natively for Mac:

**Voice Ink**: Fantastic for people who want control and power-mode switching. One-time payment, local models, and a solid dev support.

**Super whisper**: Best for power users who want full control and unlimited AI processing. Also one-time payment, with local models.

**Willow Voice**: The devs here are amazing. They respond in minutes and fix things quickly. Mac native app. It’s subscription-based, which I don’t love, but it’s the fastest and most accurate dictation tool I’ve used. Formatting for emails is spot on, which I haven’t seen from the others."

I've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.

**My Wispr Flow Review**

**Pros**

* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.
* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.
* Fairly accurate

**Cons**

* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in "casual voice".
* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.
* Often misses the first word of a sentence.
* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.

**My Aqua Voice Review**

**Pros**

* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.
* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. 

**Cons**

* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.
* Same first-word bug as Wispr.
* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.

Hope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?"

   Use_Case: Copying and pasting dictated text
   Quote: "dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message"
   Full Review: "Issues with Messaging Integration, Activation Delay, and macOS Installation

Description:
Yesterday, the app worked seamlessly with text messaging. Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.

However, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.

Additionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.

Steps to Reproduce:
	1.	Attempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.
	2.	Observe that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.
	3.	Attempt to download the macOS app.
	4.	Note that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”

Expected Behavior:
	•	Wispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.
	•	macOS installation should complete without redirect loops.

Actual Behavior:
	•	Wispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.
	•	The macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.

Environment:
	•	iOS version: 18.1 (latest)
	•	macOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)
	•	Wispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼

Request:
Please advise on resolving:
	•	The messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.
	•	The macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop."

   Use_Case: Adding custom dictionary entries
   Quote: "adding them to the dictionary makes this work nearly perfectly"
   Full Review: "Issues but VERY Good

OK, so the first thing to understand is that this is basically just sending your dictation to a large language model somewhere in the cloud and producing more intelligent dictation than the onboard that Apple uses.   That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   

Unfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    

Frustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. 

But I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. 

I look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here.."

I'm writing this using the app! I'll be honest that I'm pretty skeptical of a lot of AI tools, but there are certain things, such as summarizing long documents, and in this case, getting closer to my real intent when trying to dictate something, that are really great uses for AI. I love the accurate punctuation and its patience when I stop or fumble with my thinking out loud."

I have tried a number of apps and dictation options and always found them wanting or clumsy enough in use to prohibit my easily taking them on board. Wispr Flow has thus far proved to be a different animal and I am beginning to use it as my sole dictation app on my iPhone and iPad. I have been so convinced by it and the uncanny way it manages to get the spelling right as well as catch the in-house phrases and words I use, so I went and changed my monthly subscription to an annual one. Very impressive. I expect to be using it for quite some time."

The quality of transcription from Wispr Flow is bar none the best I've ever used across all my different AI transcription softwares, and the mobile app is really nice. I wish Apple would not require app switching, but other than that it works wonders and it's very easy to use. You will not go wrong with this application. It makes working on your phone much faster. I can talk way faster than I can ever type on my phone. And Wispr Flow really captures the meaning of what I'm trying to say. I can talk in little segments, edit, and move my cursor around, and it will paste in whatever I transcribed into that section. It's lickety-split fast. It's the fastest transcription I have ever seen. I've used it for well over a year now, and I love it."

   Full Review: "If I could give it 42 stars, I would, because Wispr Flow is the meaning of life.

Man, this absolutely rocks! I have bigger hands, and as I'm getting older, over 55, it's harder to see the little phone and it's hard to type. So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.

When using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say. So you have less chance of having confusing messages."

I got this app to dictate texts and emails as Im in sales and unfortunately a lot of sales happen on the go and not at a desk. After a few weeks of use it suddenly doesn’t work at all. It will mostly not even begin transcribing when I press the check mark — no matter how many times, it is unresponsive. OR if it does allow me to press the check mark, it just says system taking longer than normal audio is saved for retry or whatever. 

This is on top of the INCREDIBLY annoying process to even start the app - the app opening then swipe back to what you’re using the app in process is RIDICULOUSLY irritating.

   Use_Case: Dictating while using the app
   Quote: "the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating"
   Full Review: "Issues but VERY Good

OK, so the first thing to understand is that this is basically just sending your dictation to a large language model somewhere in the cloud and producing more intelligent dictation than the onboard that Apple uses.   That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   

Unfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    

Frustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. 

But I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. 

I look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here.."

   Use_Case: Dictating in messaging
   Quote: "the app worked seamlessly with text messaging"
   Full Review: "Issues with Messaging Integration, Activation Delay, and macOS Installation

Description:
Yesterday, the app worked seamlessly with text messaging. Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.

However, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.

Additionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.

Steps to Reproduce:
	1.	Attempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.
	2.	Observe that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.
	3.	Attempt to download the macOS app.
	4.	Note that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”

Expected Behavior:
	•	Wispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.
	•	macOS installation should complete without redirect loops.

Actual Behavior:
	•	Wispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.
	•	The macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.

Environment:
	•	iOS version: 18.1 (latest)
	•	macOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)
	•	Wispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼

Request:
Please advise on resolving:
	•	The messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.
	•	The macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop."

This app was a really cool fun to use app it helped a lot with my punctuation and it’s great how I can whisper so quietly like I can be barely audible and it could still pick up what I’m saying another really cool feature is the ads quotation mark so when you do like that, he said she said it like quote it it’s really cool The only downside is flow stays on continuously and it’s constantly in use like you will see the little orange highlight on your clock so that’s the only thing I don’t really like about it. But other than that, you can turn it off and it’s super easy to get back on while you’re texting. I just have to turn it off after every text but other than that it’s a really really awesome app and I would recommend it to anybody who asked"

   Quote: "Flow works best when dictating in a single language."
   Full Post: "Hi u/freesk8r and u/Odd_Category_1038,

Thanks for reaching out, and I hope I can help with some of your issues.

To disable commands, extensive formatting and auto-actions, the best option right now is to turn off Smart Formatting in Settings → System. That will stop Flow from interpreting structured phrases like “write an email,” though it may also make formatting less natural in some cases. With Smart Formatting turned off, normal dictation will only record and transcribe. 

Can you also confirm whether you’re using [Command Mode](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/8476991260-command-mode) or just normal dictation? That helps us pinpoint what’s triggering the actions. 

As for the Cyrillic text issue, Flow works best when dictating in a single language. Mixed text (like Cyrillic plus English) can cause encoding problems. For now, we suggest:

* Keeping the original message with Cyrillic characters copied somewhere safe before dictating.
* Avoid giving commands on Cyrillic text.
* After dictation, paste the original Cyrillic text back in manually to preserve characters.

This should prevent further corruption while our team looks into improving how different text formats are handled."

The extra line breaks you’re seeing are actually intentional. We automatically add them after longer pauses to make text easier to read and less like one big block of text. Most people find it helpful because it keeps everything clean and spaced out.

That said, I totally get how that would be frustrating in your case, especially if you’re dictating longer essays where everything needs to stay in one paragraph.

Flow isn’t really built for recording meetings. It’s optimized for shorter (think &lt;5 min) bursts of speech, like writing follow-ups, jotting down thoughts, or replying to messages. 

Meeting recorders work differently. They handle long, continuous audio streams with significant lag before you get a full transcript. Flow transcribes your words almost immediately, and in any text box where you type. 

So we're less of a "meeting recorder" and more of a "voice keyboard" if that makes sense!"

So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.

However, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.

I was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.

This is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?

I really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.

Any tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?

I'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...

   Full Post: "Happy to report that the two very cheap chinese RF lapel mics I ordered from Amazon work really great with wispr flow!! (one ultra cheap at $7.99 USD and another fancier one at $19.99 which I love due to their case) My buetooth airpods really did not work at all with the app.

You better mention this in your docs because **I was about to cancel my subscription until the wireless mic idea crossed my mind** and I am happy it did, now I am giving away my link to lots of friends and encouraging them to try it, its simply awesome!

And also ordered another 3 wireless mic for my team mates to code with, its a game changer!

   Full Post: "Hey  u/Diligent_Rope3144, thanks a ton for this super clear write-up.

You’re right that the **toggle/mic state mismatch** is a bug. The toggle should always reflect the true mic status. We’ll make sure that gets fixed in an upcoming update.

To better understand the rest of your workflow (and make sure we’re improving the right thing), could you share a bit more context?

* What’s your main reason for turning Flow on from the **in-app toggle** instead of the **keyboard mic**?
* When you do that, are you usually trying to keep Flow running in the **background** (e.g., for longer dictation), or just to make it faster to re-activate?
* How often do you use the “Immediately turn off” setting vs other timeouts?

We’re exploring whether the toggle should override that “immediate turn-off” behavior, or whether it makes more sense to clarify what it does in the UI. Your input will help!"

   Full Post: "I will emphasize this again; I really believe you guys need to add, at the very least, a basic lettering keyboard asap. 

Switching back and forth is really inconvenient, and I would rather have a basic keyboard to make small edits with now and wait until you expand your mobile team for the complete keyboard with all the bells and whistles. 

I personally have referred multiple people who didn’t end up paying because this wasn't a feature. 

For context, anyone who has more than the English keyboard added switching to Wispr Flow becomes a giant hassle of cycling through all the keyboards that you have selected, so having to continuously switch back and forth between the English and the Wispr one makes it too much work. (I implore you guys to try adding any other language and then try using it on a daily basis. You'll see how frustrating it is.)"

**WisprFlow** is the only app with which I’m having this issue. Does anyone know why? I have about eight other shortcuts configured with different apps, and all of them work fine—except this one.

Has anyone found a solution? Multitouch also allows running **bash commands**, in case WisprFlow supports that…

   Quote: "it can also freeze whatever app I’m working in."
   Full Post: "Does anyone else experience app freezes when using voice input together with text editing? The biggest problem is that Wispr Flow often freezes, and when it does, it can also freeze whatever app I’m working in. At first, I thought it was the fault of the apps themselves (like having too many browser tabs open), but when Notepad++ started freezing too, it became really irritating.

This might be related to my use case - I use voice input together with editing and pasting new text. When I’m using Wispr Flow and paste from the clipboard with Ctrl+V, these freezes start happening. Sometimes the cursor even jumps around unexpectedly.

Does anyone else experience app freezes when using voice input together with text editing?"

Hence, I am building a voice AI management companion to help individuals become the best versions of themselves. I started with using chat GPT's Whisper - 1 model. This was a disaster. 

I then one day had an idea and epiphany really to start relying on Wispr Flow entirely. My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. 

Since switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application. So does Wispr Flow have an API similar to Deepgram or OpenAI?"

   Full Post: "Why voice is still hard (and what keeps us up at night at Wispr Flow) 👋 I’m Sahaj Garg, CTO of Wispr Flow. 

Building Wispr Flow has been the most fun (and humbling) engineering challenge of my career. Voice feels magical when it works instantly, but making it reliable at scale means solving a lot of problems that are still unsolved in the field.

Here are some of the biggest ones we’re working on:

* **Latency:** People won’t wait. We have \~700ms to get from speech → formatted text, even on bad Wi-Fi. Anything slower feels broken.
* **Ambiguous audio:** A short clip could mean ten different things without context. (If you want to see some examples that show the audio clip, raw transcription, desired transcription, and key challenges explained, [check out this blog post here](https://wisprflow.ai/post/speech-recognition-challenges).)
* **Learning from corrections:** If you fix Flow once, it should never repeat the mistake. The hard part is capturing the edits, determining which edits should be repeated (and in what contexts to apply them), and then training an LLM to precisely follow those edits.
* **Whisper mode:** People want to use Flow in offices, trains, and libraries. Making automatic speech recognition (ASR) work when you’re basically mumbling into your mic is its own frontier.
* **Multilingual code-switching:** Around the world, people mix languages in the same sentence. Most ASR models collapse here, but successfully solving it unlocks global voice.
* **Scale:** Users already dictate over a billion words a month. That number is about to 10x, and latency still has to stay flat.

   Full Post: "Assume I'm dictating "I have a dog. My dog has fleas. " 

If I dictate that as two separate sentences, removing my finger from the function key between the sentences, the result is this 

"I have a dog.My dog has fleas. " 

Notice the lack of a space between the two sentences after the period which follows dog. Does that help?"

   Use_Case: Manually selecting language before dictating
   Quote: "The only workaround I have so far is to select manually the language before talking."
   Full Post: "Issue with switch language auto detect I have good experience with WPF, but I’ve been facing a problem from the beginning. When I use Autodetect or select two languages, in my case French and English, whenever I speak in French or English, there is sometimes work/mixing between the two languages. It would be better to add a shortcut for each voice to avoid this problem.

The only workaround I have so far is to select manually the language before talking.

I’ve also added several tickets about this issue, but I’m still without a solution or without a response to the last one.

So am I the only one in this situation?"

   Use_Case: Mixing languages while dictating
   Quote: "many bilingual people like to mix their languages mid-sentence"
   Full Post: "Hey u/syeod_ thanks for raising this! 

Unfortunately, we have to make trade-offs between the accuracy of our language detection and the latency of our model (e.g. how long it takes for the text to appear.) We also don't currently support the option to switch languages in the middle of a dictation, which is tricky because I know that many bilingual people like to mix their languages mid-sentence. 

Your idea to add a shortcut to switch between languages is a great suggestion. I just chatted with the engineers about it, and we'll look into adding this as a feature!

In the meantime, if you report these issues + add a note in the app as they happen, it will be a huge help as we work to improve this."

   Full Post: "Thanks for your answer. Just to give more detail. I am not speaking about changing language or mix language during one sentence. 

I am talking basic function, like i speak in english my text and it translate it in French ( while auto dectect  is enable or when i select only French and English) 

  
It works only when i select only English in the languages. 

(and may be 2/10 it works well with autodect while i am speaking english)"

   Full Post: "About Wispr Flow’s iOS keyboard I’ve been a Wispr Flow user for a few months now. On Mac, it works beautifully and has become part of my daily workflow. But on iOS, I keep running into issues that I can’t quite wrap my head around.

1. **Default keyboard problem** I’ve already dragged Wispr Flow to the top of my iOS keyboard list (so it should technically be the default), but whenever I switch to a new app, I still have to manually bring it up. It feels clunky. From what I understand, it might be because Wispr Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard—it only has a number pad and a mic button. But if that’s the case… why not just make it a full keyboard? Spokenly, for example, doesn’t run into this exact issue (though it has other problems, like being unusable in Safari and some native iOS apps).
2. **Background permissions** Another hurdle is that I need to constantly jump back into the app to re-enable mic access, especially when switching input devices (like putting on headphones). This breaks the flow and makes quick capture harder than it should be.

These don’t *seem* like unsolvable problems, so I’m wondering—am I missing something here?"

We know many of you have likely seen a Reddit post from a year ago, right after launch when the product was buggy, privacy/security info was unclear, and our “marketing” was a scrappy contractor who did things we don’t stand by. 

Since then, we’ve overhauled security (SOC 2, HIPAA, Privacy Mode), fixed the system issues, and built a full-time marketing team committed to authentic, two-way dialogue on this subreddit. 

**Privacy &amp; Security**

* **SOC 2 Type II** compliance for Enterprise plans, **HIPAA** compliance available on all plans, and **ISO 27001 coming soon!** 
* **Privacy Mode:** You can turn this on at any time if you go to your app &gt; Settings &gt;  Data and Privacy. It will trigger Zero Data Retention, meaning no audio or transcripts are stored. If you turn it off, dictations *may* be used to improve our features, but it’s never sold or shared. 
* **No third-party sharing:** Dictation data is never sold or shared with third parties. Period.
* **Data is encrypted** in transit/at rest, and never shared with third parties.

**Product Fixes**

* **Auto-login bug fixed:** Wispr no longer re-adds itself to login items if you turn it off.
* **Browser integrations clarified:** Wispr doesn’t inject into Chrome/Firefox or any app anymore. 
* **Performance optimized:** We’ve slimmed down the app and reduced idle resource usage significantly.
* **Context awareness:** Flow uses nearby text in your active app to improve transcription accuracy (like in the case of an uncommonly spelled name.) You can turn this off at any time if you go to Settings &gt; Data &amp; Privacy &gt; Context Awareness.

**Community &amp; Transparency**

* **Slack removal:** It was wrong to remove someone from our Slack community for raising concerns. We know there’s room to improve, and we *want* to hear it.

We're really sorry about the delay in support. We recently transitioned customer support systems, and that’s unfortunately slowed us down on responses. The good news is that we're actively hiring and training new support folks, so we will be much more responsive going forward! 

I'm actually a huge fan of Every's newsletter, but I do want to highlight some features that set us apart from Monologue: 

* Cross-platform availability: we're available on Mac, Windows, and iPhone while Monologue is just on Mac. 
* Enterprise-grade security: SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance 
* Features for developers: If you're a developer or vibe coder, you'll notice that Flow actually understands your code. In Cursor and Windsurf, you can even tag files. 
* [Snippets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WisprFlow/comments/1nimgwg/lpt_tired_of_retyping_the_same_things_try/): You can create custom voice shortcuts for things like booking links or outreach templates instead of typing them over and over.

Longer dictations are an area we’re still improving. Most of our testing so far has been on shorter dictations, so when you hit the 4–5 min mark the reliability isn’t always where we want it yet.

   Full Post: "I agree. This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. 

The simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. 

However, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. 

This app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well."

   Full Post: "My review of Wispr Flow and Aqua Voice dictation has single handedly 2Xed my productivity over the last month! So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.

I've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.

**My Wispr Flow Review**

**Pros**

* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.
* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.
* Fairly accurate

**Cons**

* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in "casual voice".
* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.
* Often misses the first word of a sentence.
* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.

**My Aqua Voice Review**

**Pros**

* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.
* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. 

**Cons**

* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.
* Same first-word bug as Wispr.
* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.

Hope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?"

This app is a game changer! I speak both Spanish and English, and Wispr Flow catches EVERYTHING perfectly, every single word, no matter which language I’m using. The accuracy is honestly mind blowing compared to my iPhone’s built in voice detection, which constantly misses words and can’t handle switching between languages.
But here’s what really sold me: I can literally whisper and it still transcribes perfectly! Whether I’m in a quiet meeting, at the library, or just don’t want to disturb people around me, it works flawlessly.
The offline feature is brilliant too no internet? No problem! It saves the audio and transcribes it later, so I never lose my thoughts. For someone who’s been frustrated with Apple’s voice dictation for years, this app feels like magic. Worth every penny! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

La realidad es que ha sido súper responsive. Me encanta la parte de que te permite seleccionar las palabras para que las puedas añadir a tu diccionario.

Es bien certera con las palabras. Puedes hablar bajito, puedes hablar alto, puedes hablar bien rápido. Y de esa manera literalmente lo escribe todo bien organizado.

Si tiene pensamientos diferentes entonces te le da los espacios pertinentes para crear entonces la línea de pensamiento por la que quieres ir.

   Use_Case: Syncing transcription history
   Quote: "I’d love to see cloud sync functionality added for our transcription history."
   Full Post: "[Feature Request] Cloud Sync for Transcription History Across Devices Hey Wispr Flow team and community!

I’d love to see cloud sync functionality added for our transcription history. Right now, each device stores everything locally, and I think having our transcripts synced across all devices would be a game-changer.

**Why this would be useful:**

1. **Access history anywhere** - Being able to view and search through my transcription history on my phone, computer, or any device where I use Wispr Flow would be incredibly convenient.
2. **Storage concerns** - Local storage is becoming a real issue. My phone already has over 1GB of documents just for the app, and I can’t even imagine how much my computer has accumulated. Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage.
2. **Backup and peace of mind** - If something happens to one device, I wouldn’t lose all my transcription history.

Of course, I understand this will be implemented as an optional feature that users can opt into if they’re comfortable sharing their transcription data and history with Wispr. That way, users who prioritize privacy can continue using local-only storage while those of us who want the convenience can take advantage of cloud sync.

Would love to hear if others are experiencing similar storage issues or would find this useful!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

   Use_Case: Copying previous transcriptions
   Quote: "to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory."
   Full Post: "Thank you so much for getting back to me and starting the conversation. 



First of all, I think that it could be useful simply from a storage perspective. Storing everything locally adds up pretty quickly.

Secondly, from a history perspective, I personally always go back to my history and either look at what I previously typed to remember what I was working on, or if I lose access to something or accidentally forget where and what I did with something that I typed. It makes it super easy just to go to my transcription history and see exactly what I typed. Thirdly, to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory.

Third of all, I think this opens the door to more personalization. If you store the transcription history, you can use it as training data to make a more custom, fine-tuned model for each user. The transcription in AI Polish is more tailored towards their style, vocabulary, and preferences, making it a more magical experience for the user. I understand that all users may not want this, but for the ones that do, it could be good to have. 

And finally, yes, I would love to have the ability to search my old notes, maybe for the past week or month. I sometimes have a vague recollection of me previously writing something, and being able to go back and check would be extremely helpful.

Finally, for the mobile-to-desktop users, I think an instant sync would be extremely helpful for everyone who's not on a Mac. Syncing what you have on mobile to desktop is a little difficult. If you could almost recreate that with your app I think it can be really helpful. The way I imagine it is I could voice-type something on my phone and then paste it on my laptop. This could be especially useful in situations where you can't verbally speak to your laptop out loud, but you can quietly whisper into the bottom of your phone.

   Full Post: "Auto-paste and “Paste last transcript” stopped working overnight Wispr Flow was working perfectly until this morning. I've been using it for a few days now (partway through the 2-week trial) and was absolutely loving the product - was 100% going to sign up for Pro. But this morning it just won't auto-paste text into any apps.

The transcription itself works fine, but instead of pasting automatically, I now get a banner saying "Click a text box and use Alt+Shift+Z to paste." Alt+Shift+Z does nothing. I've tried:

* Right-click → "Paste last transcript" - nothing
* Changing the keyboard shortcuts to something else - nothing
* Uninstalling the application completely
* Uninstalling then deleting all the Wispr folders I could find, then reinstalling
* Testing in Chrome, Notepad, Word, Discord - won't paste into any of them

The only way I can use it now is to go into the actual Flow app and manually copy the text, then paste it where I want it, which completely defeats the purpose.

I've checked for Windows updates - there were none last night or this morning when I turned on my machine. I just can't get my head around what could be causing this. It was literally working perfectly when I shut down last night.

Because I really like that feature that Wispr Flow has. And I don't know if any of the models in Spokenly have that feature or not, or if I have to come up with my own AI post-processing prompt to clean up my text a bit and transcriptions and dictations to make it sound better or more clear.

We actually used to have a full letter keyboard in Flow, but in practice it wasn’t as smooth as Apple’s for text editing. Things like long-pressing to move the cursor vertically or using certain gestures are restricted by iOS, which made the experience feel clunky. That’s why we ended up focusing our current keyboard on quick punctuation and small edits. It’s optimized to switch seamlessly back to Apple’s for deeper edits.

That said, we do plan to bring back a complete Flow keyboard (letters, autocorrect, swipe typing, and more) at some point once we expand our iOS and ML engineering team. It’s not a trivial build given Apple’s sandbox restrictions, but it’s something we’re actively planning for.

   Full Post: "Hi u/freesk8r and u/Odd_Category_1038,

Thanks for reaching out, and I hope I can help with some of your issues.

To disable commands, extensive formatting and auto-actions, the best option right now is to turn off Smart Formatting in Settings → System. That will stop Flow from interpreting structured phrases like “write an email,” though it may also make formatting less natural in some cases. With Smart Formatting turned off, normal dictation will only record and transcribe. 

Can you also confirm whether you’re using [Command Mode](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/8476991260-command-mode) or just normal dictation? That helps us pinpoint what’s triggering the actions. 

As for the Cyrillic text issue, Flow works best when dictating in a single language. Mixed text (like Cyrillic plus English) can cause encoding problems. For now, we suggest:

* Keeping the original message with Cyrillic characters copied somewhere safe before dictating.
* Avoid giving commands on Cyrillic text.
* After dictation, paste the original Cyrillic text back in manually to preserve characters.

This should prevent further corruption while our team looks into improving how different text formats are handled."

That being said, you can still get a lot of value out of using Flow in VSCode and Claude Code, but we don't fully support file tagging there (yet.) [This is one of our YouTube partners who still really enjoys using Flow in Claude Code.](https://youtu.be/0jpcFxY_38k?si=wJbO1zy-JZZDCWSI&amp;t=415)"

   Full Post: "Anyone else’s auto-paste just stop working? Been loving Wispr Flow so far — super smooth and was ready to go Pro.

But today the **auto-paste suddenly died**. 



Tried reinstalling, resetting hotkeys, testing in Chrome/Word/Discord — same issue.

Now I have to copy manually from the app, which kinda kills the flow 😅.



Is it just me, or anyone else seeing this?"

We're really sorry about the delay in support. We recently transitioned customer support systems, and that’s unfortunately slowed us down on responses. The good news is that we're actively hiring and training new support folks, so we will be much more responsive going forward! 

I'm actually a huge fan of Every's newsletter, but I do want to highlight some features that set us apart from Monologue: 

* Cross-platform availability: we're available on Mac, Windows, and iPhone while Monologue is just on Mac. 
* Enterprise-grade security: SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance 
* Features for developers: If you're a developer or vibe coder, you'll notice that Flow actually understands your code. In Cursor and Windsurf, you can even tag files. 
* [Snippets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WisprFlow/comments/1nimgwg/lpt_tired_of_retyping_the_same_things_try/): You can create custom voice shortcuts for things like booking links or outreach templates instead of typing them over and over. 

**And as someone who's been around since the early days, I'd love to hear any feedback you might have on how we can make both our product and our community better!**"

I use dictation as many people do because it is so much faster than texting.

It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. 

This app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived. I used this for 5 minutes before I was like, "this is just going to be part of my life now. It's that good." You see what it did there? It added quotes automatically. Incredible."

When I first started using Wispr Flow, I didn’t expect it to have as much impact as it has. Typing has always been one of those bottlenecks in my day, emails, proposals, notes, you name it. With Wispr Flow, that bottleneck is gone. It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.

What stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.

For me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool. It’s become a core part of how I work every single day, on my Apple mobile devices, my MacBook and my Desktop. If you’re serious about improving workflow and making better use of your time, it’s a no-brainer."

   Use_Case: Writing stories
   Quote: "I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories"
   Full Review: "Issues but VERY Good

OK, so the first thing to understand is that this is basically just sending your dictation to a large language model somewhere in the cloud and producing more intelligent dictation than the onboard that Apple uses.   That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   

Unfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    

Frustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. 

But I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. 

I look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here.."

Wispr Flow has completely changed how I capture ideas and get work done. It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.

The convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.

I’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.

If you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have. It just works—and it works really well."

I would have given 5 stars or 4 because, although we find it difficult to insert punctuation, I have to give it 2 because it has been a week since I started having problems.

They are probably trying to fix it because yesterday I saw a slight improvement, but in reality, even with the paid subscription I took out, I have not been able to use the product for over a week.

In the meantime, double-check that your Style is set to *Formal* and Smart Formatting is turned on under *Settings → System*. That setup gives the best results while we work on a proper fix.

   Full Post: "Hi u/Whereforart,

I totally understand why that is a pain having to change the font of Flows output. And you're not alone in experiencing it. Flow pastes clean, unformatted text by default to ensure consistency across apps, which is why Gmail switches back to its default font. A simple workaround is to dictate in another app like Flow Notes, then copy and paste your text into Gmail and apply your preferred font once — that should keep things consistent.

I’ll also share this with our product team to see if we can make Flow more flexible with fonts in the future. Thank you for reaching out and please follow up with any more questions or concerns!"

Personally, I also use Formal for everything, however I wish I can set super personal custom criteria for individual apps. 

Such as when I am in Gmail to always use a certain email template that is more specific than just the current options, or when I am in my task management app to always capitalize all words (task titles)."

   Quote: "I'm writing an essay, and it's important that I stay in the same paragraph."
   Full Post: "Flow inserts blank lines during longer dictation. Can this be prevented? I’m using Wispr Flow on Windows. Because of a disability and a speech impairment I speak a bit slower, and Flow has been a big help for speed and accuracy. However, when I dictate longer passages, Flow starts inserting blank lines between sentences. This is the case in every app. I'm writing an essay, and it's important that I stay in the same paragraph. My current workaround is to stop dictation after each sentence and start it again; it prevents the extra line, but it slows me down and breaks my rhythm. Is there a way to force continuous text in a single paragraph (i.e., never send Enter unless I explicitly press it)? Thanks!"

   Quote: "writing follow-ups"
   Full Post: "Hey u/brewha5151: 

Flow isn’t really built for recording meetings. It’s optimized for shorter (think &lt;5 min) bursts of speech, like writing follow-ups, jotting down thoughts, or replying to messages. 

Meeting recorders work differently. They handle long, continuous audio streams with significant lag before you get a full transcript. Flow transcribes your words almost immediately, and in any text box where you type. 

So we're less of a "meeting recorder" and more of a "voice keyboard" if that makes sense!"

   Full Post: "Hey u/Diligent_Rope3144, really appreciate you taking the time to share this!

Flow Notes already sync between desktop and iOS, so anything you save there is accessible everywhere. But we haven’t prioritized cloud sync for full transcription history because most people use Flow as an interface to send text into their other apps, not as a place to store or search everything long-term. Once a dictation is sent to email, docs, or chat, that’s where it usually lives and stays searchable.

We’ve also found that this use case is pretty rare. In fact, a relatively small portion of our users is regularly activating on both desktop AND iOS, so there just isn't much demand for full cross-device history.

That said, it’s helpful to understand what you’d want to use it for. Are you mostly looking to revisit past transcriptions or reuse old notes? That kind of context helps us think about whether a lighter option, like selective sync or export, might make sense in the future.

Thanks again for starting the discussion!"

I wanted to take a moment to express my positive experience with command mode recently. It has significantly improved my workflow, and I truly appreciate the effort that has gone into it!

I’m exploring the best way to convey this feedback. Should I utilize the report feedback feature inside the Wispr Flow app, or is there an alternative channel for positive comments?

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your guidance!

I’m Victoria with Wispr Flow. We make voice-to-text that’s fast, accurate, secure, and works on all your apps (Gmail, Slack, ChatGPT, Notion, Cursor). We want to remove the hassle of typing so you can answer emails, write detailed AI prompts, or brain dump ideas as naturally as talking to a friend. 

I started this subreddit because I wanted to create a space where Flow isn’t just “our product,” but something we build alongside the people who rely on it every day. Think of this as a two-way dialogue: we’ll share what we’re building, and you’ll share what’s working, what’s broken, and what you wish existed. 

Here’s some of what you’ll see here:

* Product updates (the good stuff, not just marketing fluff) 
* Guides &amp; workflow breakdowns (for coding, journaling, PRDs, brain-dumps, you name it)
* Security deep dives (what Zero Data Retention, SOC 2, and HIPAA actually mean for you)
* Feature request threads (where your voice actually matters) 
* Community productivity challenges (with cool prizes!) 
* Job postings (we’re hiring across engineering, marketing, recruiting, and design) 

We’re rooting for your success with Flow and hopefully, you’ll root for ours too. But more than that: help us make this space useful for you!

Excited to get this rolling with you all!

Longer dictations are an area we’re still improving. Most of our testing so far has been on shorter dictations, so when you hit the 4–5 min mark the reliability isn’t always where we want it yet.

   Quote: "overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well."
   Full Post: "I agree. This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. 

The simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. 

However, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. 

This app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well."

   Full Post: "My review of Wispr Flow and Aqua Voice dictation has single handedly 2Xed my productivity over the last month! So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.

I've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.

**My Wispr Flow Review**

**Pros**

* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.
* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.
* Fairly accurate

**Cons**

* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in "casual voice".
* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.
* Often misses the first word of a sentence.
* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.

**My Aqua Voice Review**

**Pros**

* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.
* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. 

**Cons**

* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.
* Same first-word bug as Wispr.
* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.

Hope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?"

This app is a game changer! I speak both Spanish and English, and Wispr Flow catches EVERYTHING perfectly, every single word, no matter which language I’m using. The accuracy is honestly mind blowing compared to my iPhone’s built in voice detection, which constantly misses words and can’t handle switching between languages.
But here’s what really sold me: I can literally whisper and it still transcribes perfectly! Whether I’m in a quiet meeting, at the library, or just don’t want to disturb people around me, it works flawlessly.
The offline feature is brilliant too no internet? No problem! It saves the audio and transcribes it later, so I never lose my thoughts. For someone who’s been frustrated with Apple’s voice dictation for years, this app feels like magic. Worth every penny! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

   Use_Case: Looking up information quickly
   Quote: "trying to look up something really quickly"
   Full Review: "Works great in calm, quiet environments, but breaks in most everyday settings

This app is great in normal, calm, quiet environments, but it honestly and fortunately works terribly in any other situation. Using it on my iPhone, it keeps on losing my transcription every time I do something long-form, especially when I'm using my AirPods. Perhaps this is a problem with AirPods, but truly I cannot keep on losing very important transcripts. I'm not always in a perfectly quiet environment. So if I'm just on the go or trying to send someone a message or trying to look up something really quickly, I can't always have 100% perfect silence.

This needs to be more robust to noise and work better with software/hardware such as AirPods, etc. It also needs to work for longer form content which is in particular an issue on the iOS app, not so much on Mac OS. I don't know if the issue is because after use it for a while it becomes slower because the required inference time or something is an issue. I don't know what it is. But this has truly had some issues with the long processing time, lost transcripts unable to work in not perfectly ideal environments, etc."

Wispr Flow has completely changed how I capture ideas and get work done. It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.

The convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.

I’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.

   Full Post: "About Wispr Flow’s iOS keyboard I’ve been a Wispr Flow user for a few months now. On Mac, it works beautifully and has become part of my daily workflow. But on iOS, I keep running into issues that I can’t quite wrap my head around.

1. **Default keyboard problem** I’ve already dragged Wispr Flow to the top of my iOS keyboard list (so it should technically be the default), but whenever I switch to a new app, I still have to manually bring it up. It feels clunky. From what I understand, it might be because Wispr Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard—it only has a number pad and a mic button. But if that’s the case… why not just make it a full keyboard? Spokenly, for example, doesn’t run into this exact issue (though it has other problems, like being unusable in Safari and some native iOS apps).
2. **Background permissions** Another hurdle is that I need to constantly jump back into the app to re-enable mic access, especially when switching input devices (like putting on headphones). This breaks the flow and makes quick capture harder than it should be.

These don’t *seem* like unsolvable problems, so I’m wondering—am I missing something here?"

Easy to use. I found this product to help with my productivity at work and in my personal life. I use this app to draft emails and send text messages. Huge time saver! This app is accurate, precise, and responds very quickly!"

   Use_Case: Replying to emails
   Quote: "reply to emails more quickly"
   Full Review: "Absolutely indispensable when you have it running on all your devices.

I started off trying this app on iOS as a means to talk to various AIs and reply to emails more quickly. I found that it's absolutely amazing how fast it is and how seamlessly it corrects your spelling and punctuation etc. Unlike the iOS built-in app.

The magic is really once you get it working on your work computer (if your work will allow it), your home computer, and your iPad. Now I can hit the Ctrl and Alt keys on any Windows app. If you pay for the full subscription here, they'll let you run it on your other computers, although you may have some issues with authentication. This app is now going to be in my permanent tool belt."

   Full Review: "The #1 AI product in 2025

This is by far the best AI app I have ever used. There are so many AI products out there, but finally, we have one that feels like a fully developed AI solution rather than just another product with AI features added on. 

Many AI tools seem to have half-baked functionalities, but this app stands out as the most remarkable one I have used. I find myself much more productive, and I no longer procrastinate on sending out emails. This app genuinely changes my life. Unlike other AI applications that require me to respond multiple times to get the answer or prompt I need, this one simplifies the process and saves me from frustration."

   Quote: "turns everything into a well-formatted, structured email"
   Full Review: "Now I can work from my phone

It took a little bit of getting used to, but once I got over the initial friction, my God, Flow for iOS has changed my life. 

I now use it for my 20-minute walks to and from work to respond to my entire inbox. I show up to the office and I don't have to get through a humongous backlog of messages anymore. It just turns everything into a well-formatted, structured email and saves me so much time. Genuinely life-changing ❤️

This whole review was written with Flow. I don't think I would have provided so much detail if I had to type it all out."

   Full Post: "Wispr Flow changes font in Gmail I like to use Flow to respond to and create emails, but it keeps changing the font part of the way through. Instead of Verdana (which is my default font in Gmail), it changes it to Sans Serif, which, of course, looks totally different. So then I have to highlight it and change it and it's a pain. I don't understand why it can't stick with the default. FWIW, I use MacOSTahoe (beta) and IOS 26.1 (beta).

Adding it on the iOS keyboard would be super awesome as well as it would also save me a lot of time and efficiency especially when texting or if I have to format an email on the go. 

So far I'm super impressed by Wispr Flow and everything they've done. But yeah, the command mode would definitely be a great game changer for the iOS keyboard."

   Use_Case: Answering questions online
   Quote: "I answer a lot of people's questions online"
   Full Post: "I know what you mean, and I consider doing that, but that implies you are duplicating everything. Like creating 10 copies of the same link. 

One thing that would be amazing is if you could either create multiple trigger phrases for the same result (different types of phrases that will bring up the same link or content). 

Or an even better idea would be to add a shortcut menu where you finish talking and then press a button to show you all the snippets. You just select the one you want, and it inserts it in line. Bonus points if you can organize them by folders or tags or something. 

I know that this is kind of beyond the scope of Wispr Flow because it's a voice app, but it would make it so much easier to recall and bring up different snippets. 

One common use case that I have is not just for coaching links, but for example, I answer a lot of people's questions online, and many times the answer to a question involves a link to one of my YouTube videos. So I have to go now and look up the video, copy the share link, and then paste it in my response. It would be amazing if I could simply say "my video on such-and-such topic" and it brings up that URL automatically. 

Maybe I am going into rag territory here. This is one idea that I mentioned to you on Twitter a while ago. For example, when I mention in my speech something about coaching link or whatever, something that might match one of my snippets, at the end of dictation it would pop up a menu with suggested snippets to include based on the keywords that I mentioned."

We're really sorry about the delay in support. We recently transitioned customer support systems, and that’s unfortunately slowed us down on responses. The good news is that we're actively hiring and training new support folks, so we will be much more responsive going forward! 

I'm actually a huge fan of Every's newsletter, but I do want to highlight some features that set us apart from Monologue: 

* Cross-platform availability: we're available on Mac, Windows, and iPhone while Monologue is just on Mac. 
* Enterprise-grade security: SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance 
* Features for developers: If you're a developer or vibe coder, you'll notice that Flow actually understands your code. In Cursor and Windsurf, you can even tag files. 
* [Snippets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WisprFlow/comments/1nimgwg/lpt_tired_of_retyping_the_same_things_try/): You can create custom voice shortcuts for things like booking links or outreach templates instead of typing them over and over.

   Full Post: "Introducing r/WisprFlow. Let's make Flow better together! Hey everyone!

I’m Victoria with Wispr Flow. We make voice-to-text that’s fast, accurate, secure, and works on all your apps (Gmail, Slack, ChatGPT, Notion, Cursor). We want to remove the hassle of typing so you can answer emails, write detailed AI prompts, or brain dump ideas as naturally as talking to a friend. 

I started this subreddit because I wanted to create a space where Flow isn’t just “our product,” but something we build alongside the people who rely on it every day. Think of this as a two-way dialogue: we’ll share what we’re building, and you’ll share what’s working, what’s broken, and what you wish existed. 

Here’s some of what you’ll see here:

* Product updates (the good stuff, not just marketing fluff) 
* Guides &amp; workflow breakdowns (for coding, journaling, PRDs, brain-dumps, you name it)
* Security deep dives (what Zero Data Retention, SOC 2, and HIPAA actually mean for you)
* Feature request threads (where your voice actually matters) 
* Community productivity challenges (with cool prizes!) 
* Job postings (we’re hiring across engineering, marketing, recruiting, and design) 

We’re rooting for your success with Flow and hopefully, you’ll root for ours too. But more than that: help us make this space useful for you!

Excited to get this rolling with you all!

– Victoria, Product Marketing Lead at Wispr"

   Use_Case: Conveying emotion in messages
   Quote: "I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say"
   Full Review: "If I could give it 42 stars, I would, because Wispr Flow is the meaning of life.

Man, this absolutely rocks! I have bigger hands, and as I'm getting older, over 55, it's harder to see the little phone and it's hard to type. So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.

When using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say. So you have less chance of having confusing messages."

   Use_Case: Communicating effectively
   Quote: "more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing"
   Full Review: "Wispr Flow: The Quiet Power Behind Getting More Done...

When I first started using Wispr Flow, I didn’t expect it to have as much impact as it has. Typing has always been one of those bottlenecks in my day, emails, proposals, notes, you name it. With Wispr Flow, that bottleneck is gone. It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.

What stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.

For me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool. It’s become a core part of how I work every single day, on my Apple mobile devices, my MacBook and my Desktop. If you’re serious about improving workflow and making better use of your time, it’s a no-brainer."

Everything syncs, and all my messages show up in the Wispr app. Feels kind of magical. If I want to find something I dictate it, I don't have to remember which app I was in.

I’ve been using dictation a lot lately and wasting so much time correcting all the mistakes that it’s not worth the time savings versus just typing it all in myself. I'm still in my two-week trial period, but so far it's doing great. It understands the nuance of what I’m trying to say and doesn’t do annoying random punctuation or use proper nouns from my contacts list. For example, "Reid a book about a Kat" instead of "Read a book about a cat." I’m sure there’s lots of other practical uses but so far this has been such a relief for someone who uses dictation a lot!"

   Full Review: "This app is truly amazing!

This app was a really cool fun to use app it helped a lot with my punctuation and it’s great how I can whisper so quietly like I can be barely audible and it could still pick up what I’m saying another really cool feature is the ads quotation mark so when you do like that, he said she said it like quote it it’s really cool The only downside is flow stays on continuously and it’s constantly in use like you will see the little orange highlight on your clock so that’s the only thing I don’t really like about it. But other than that, you can turn it off and it’s super easy to get back on while you’re texting. I just have to turn it off after every text but other than that it’s a really really awesome app and I would recommend it to anybody who asked"

So far, a pretty cool thing to:

2. Text with somebody much faster and in the proper way because it also does all the grammatical stuff and aligns with your writing habits."

   Quote: "answering texts while walking"
   Full Review: "I used to be extremely skeptical of voice-to-text. I type so fast, and I was used to all the options being extremely inaccurate. Wispr Flow changed everything, and I'm a believer now. No matter how fast you type, it's a total gamechanger for prompting ChatGPT with more context or answering texts while walking. They also recently added snippets, which let me just say a command instead of typing or copying + pasting the same things over and over."

   Quote: "Free 14-day trials for every invited teammate, even if they’ve already done an individual trial"
   Full Post: "Every teammate you invite now gets a 14-day Flow Pro trial, even if they’ve already tried it before Hey everyone, we’ve just rolled out one of our biggest updates to how teams use Wispr Flow.

# Before

Flow Pro was only available for individual users, and teams had to upgrade to a separate **Flow Teams** plan.

That plan required:

* Upfront payment to add new members
* A minimum of 3 seats
* No free trials for teammates

# Now

That’s changing.

**Flow Pro now works for both individuals and teams**, with: 

* **Free 14-day trials for every invited teammate,** even if they’ve already done an individual trial
* **No upfront payments** or seat minimums required

And we'll still have: 

* **Centralized billing and admin controls**, with a revamped admin portal 
* **Shared Snippets and Dictionary** for consistent templates and terminology across your team

The goal is to make it risk-free to bring your whole team onto Flow, try the full Pro experience together, and upgrade only once you’re ready.

# For Larger Teams

**Flow Enterprise** still covers everything for organizations that need stricter security or compliance:

* SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance
* Enforced HIPAA compliance and Zero Data Retention
* SSO/SAML integration
* Bulk pricing options

You can start small on Flow Pro and upgrade to Enterprise seamlessly when you need those controls.

   Full Post: "Personalized Style: Make Flow sound more like you! Before, Wispr Flow automatically formatted your text differently depending on whether you were in an email app or a messaging app. In **emails**, Flow used full punctuation, capitalization, and line breaks to look polished. In **messaging apps**, Flow made things a bit lighter and more casual.

That worked fine for most people, but it didn’t always reflect your personal writing style.

Now with **Personalized Style**, you now decide how Flow formats your text based on the type of app, so you always sound like *you*.

Choose your preferred formatting for each type of app:

* **Personal messaging apps** (iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram)
* **Work messaging apps** (Slack, Teams)
* **Email apps** (Gmail, Outlook, Superhuman)
* **Other apps** (Docs, Notes, ChatGPT, etc.)

Depending on the app category, you’ll be able to choose from **Very Casual, Casual, Excited, or Formal.** Flow will automatically apply your chosen **punctuation** and **capitalization** whenever you dictate. However, your words stay yours: Flow won't alter your grammar, phrasing, or word choice.

**To try it out, open your Flow Desktop app and go to Style from your lefthand navigation.**

Flow isn’t really built for recording meetings. It’s optimized for shorter (think &lt;5 min) bursts of speech, like writing follow-ups, jotting down thoughts, or replying to messages. 

Meeting recorders work differently. They handle long, continuous audio streams with significant lag before you get a full transcript. Flow transcribes your words almost immediately, and in any text box where you type. 

So we're less of a "meeting recorder" and more of a "voice keyboard" if that makes sense!"

Flow Notes already sync between desktop and iOS, so anything you save there is accessible everywhere. But we haven’t prioritized cloud sync for full transcription history because most people use Flow as an interface to send text into their other apps, not as a place to store or search everything long-term. Once a dictation is sent to email, docs, or chat, that’s where it usually lives and stays searchable.

We’ve also found that this use case is pretty rare. In fact, a relatively small portion of our users is regularly activating on both desktop AND iOS, so there just isn't much demand for full cross-device history.

That said, it’s helpful to understand what you’d want to use it for. Are you mostly looking to revisit past transcriptions or reuse old notes? That kind of context helps us think about whether a lighter option, like selective sync or export, might make sense in the future.

Thanks again for starting the discussion!"

So I would have to put my phone up near my mouth and whisper if I need to send a quick text message or email somebody or take some notes, etc. So for me anyways, Because of the way I set it up, it never uses the AirPods microphone.

As for using it on the laptop, I don't know why but my AirPods microphone don't pick up too well and it doesn't  work too well with wispr flow. Like it misses a lot of words and sentences. So I just use the built-in microphone on my laptop. And because of this, it makes working in public spaces, especially in a really loud environment, kind of challenging because the microphone is trying to pick up all the distracting noises in the background along with my voice so it sometimes misses a lot of key words or even sentences. 

So I generally try and find a more quiet space and I speak at a more moderate volume."

I’m Victoria with Wispr Flow. We make voice-to-text that’s fast, accurate, secure, and works on all your apps (Gmail, Slack, ChatGPT, Notion, Cursor). We want to remove the hassle of typing so you can answer emails, write detailed AI prompts, or brain dump ideas as naturally as talking to a friend. 

I started this subreddit because I wanted to create a space where Flow isn’t just “our product,” but something we build alongside the people who rely on it every day. Think of this as a two-way dialogue: we’ll share what we’re building, and you’ll share what’s working, what’s broken, and what you wish existed. 

Here’s some of what you’ll see here:

* Product updates (the good stuff, not just marketing fluff) 
* Guides &amp; workflow breakdowns (for coding, journaling, PRDs, brain-dumps, you name it)
* Security deep dives (what Zero Data Retention, SOC 2, and HIPAA actually mean for you)
* Feature request threads (where your voice actually matters) 
* Community productivity challenges (with cool prizes!) 
* Job postings (we’re hiring across engineering, marketing, recruiting, and design) 

We’re rooting for your success with Flow and hopefully, you’ll root for ours too. But more than that: help us make this space useful for you!

Excited to get this rolling with you all!

– Victoria, Product Marketing Lead at Wispr"

   Full Post: "I agree. This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. 

The simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. 

However, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. 

This app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well."
