What I got was a barely-disguised Electron app that runs like a pig. My M2 MacBook Pro, which normally handles my entire dev stack without breaking a sweat, starts spinning up the fans the second I launch this garbage.\n\nIt's supposed to be a seamless, system-wide tool, but it's constantly draining my battery and making my whole system lag. It's the antithesis of a native Mac app. The interface is clunky, the menus are slow, and the whole thing feels like a bad web wrapper. I've had better performance from free, open-source tools.\n\nIf you value your battery life and system performance, stay away from Wispr Flow. It's a prime example of lazy development being sold at a premium price.\n\nHas anyone else noticed how badly this app performs on modern macOS hardware?\n\n\n\n",

I saw the earlier fair‑warning thread on Wispr Flow and the stuff folks raised about big CPU usage, auto‑readding itself to login items and the privacy policy being a bit fuzzy. That’s actually why I ended up building [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) in the first place :-)\n\nOurs is \"hold‑to‑talk\": we only record while you hold a hotkey or mouse button. When you let go, the mic stops and there’s no hidden background process or browser plug‑in. The installer is about 100 MB and CPU usage stays near zero when idle. We also don’t store your audio or transcripts – they stay on your machine, we just stream audio for transcription and then it’s gone.\n\nThis isn’t meant to trash Wispr Flow – they’ve clearly been improving – but if anyone here is still looking for an alternative that’s lightweight and transparent, give [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) a look. I’m a solo founder so all feedback is welcome (even if it’s \"your app sucks\"). [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/)",

Helps a lot. Use my referral link, please! It would really help because then I can get more months. But it is genuinely such a time saver.  By the way, it only works on Windows, Mac, and iOS.

However, in my view, it’s the wrong approach to prioritize promotion over user intention. The goal should be to make it as easy as possible for users to provide feedback and suggest improvements. A great product generates visibility on its own — satisfied users will happily share their experiences.\n\nRemember your customer: The perfect tool should save time and effort. We are highly efficient people who want to save time and work as effectively as possible in general. Having to create a Reddit account just to give feedback on another tool and searching for subreddits, while reading each one to find the one with the same intent, feels like an unnecessary hurdle. I am absolutely against the idea of using Wispr in this manner.\n\nIn the end, this unfortunately comes across as yet another unconventional path Wispr is taking — one that risks slowing things down rather than accelerating growth. On top of that, Reddit offers weaker structure and discoverability for such matters (which might be a reason tools like Canny exist). There’s no roadmap transparency, and if activity really does scale, things will quickly become completely unmanageable.\n\nI use Wispr because it's really fast, but other tools are emerging quickly, and they have features I absolutely miss in Wispr. I hope you will be ahead in that race.",

I was in the community while the Slack removal happened - and subsequently saw the Reddit conversation as well. This ENTIRE incident was meant to be a coverup for the fact that they were completely insecure and leaking user data. In other words, they were\n\n\\- collecting user data without user explicit permission\n\n\\- collecting data that also wasn't even made aware to users (like screenshots of users' computers).\n\nAbsolutely not the right way to handle it at all. Sundowning the entire community, which we were actively a part of, was also not the right decision. There's barely any maintenance or any communication to loyal customers.\n\n2.

I love Voice AI top 2% of Flow users for the past several months. \n\nHence, I am building a voice AI management companion to help individuals become the best versions of themselves. I started with using chat GPT's Whisper - 1 model. This was a disaster. \n\nI then one day had an idea and epiphany really to start relying on Wispr Flow entirely. My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. \n\nSince switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application.

The built in speech to text that's in Windows is much more reliable in this regard and it works in real time so if it's not recognizing your text area or theres a mic glitch you at least you'll be able to tell before you go on and on speaking entire paragraphs to then find out it wasn't listening all along or it had no idea where you wanted that text to go.

However, a personal message to the developers and the marketing team. This is a keyboard app. I don't need recurring marketing emails sent to me multiple times after I download the app. I don't need notifications popping up on my phone from this app telling me about your other features. I know you're trying to make it more than a keyboard app, but literally just market to your super consumers. You're a keyboard app that has perfected speech-to-text. It is the best speech-to-text app and keyboard on the App Store by far. We don't need notifications, we don't need marketing emails - like you built a really, really great app, focus on that. Don't annoy your customers with emails and notifications that they don't want because it's just annoying and it really takes away from the great app that you guys built.\n\nIf the purpose of the notifications and email marketing is to drive people to purchase the pro version, just stop. Charge people $3 for the app - one-time purchase, unlimited use. This is the best keyboard app on the market, but you're annoying your customers with all of the notifications and the emails. And you could definitely charge people for this app, and I guarantee you, people will pay money for it. It is that good. But you need to seriously shift your strategy because you're not going to make money selling this pro notes feature. It's just not going to happen for you guys.

However, a personal message to the developers and the marketing team. This is a keyboard app. I don't need recurring marketing emails sent to me multiple times after I download the app. I don't need notifications popping up on my phone from this app telling me about your other features. I know you're trying to make it more than a keyboard app, but literally just market to your super consumers. You're a keyboard app that has perfected speech-to-text. It is the best speech-to-text app and keyboard on the App Store by far. We don't need notifications, we don't need marketing emails - like you built a really, really great app, focus on that. Don't annoy your customers with emails and notifications that they don't want because it's just annoying and it really takes away from the great app that you guys built.\n\nIf the purpose of the notifications and email marketing is to drive people to purchase the pro version, just stop. Charge people $3 for the app - one-time purchase, unlimited use. This is the best keyboard app on the market, but you're annoying your customers with all of the notifications and the emails. And you could definitely charge people for this app, and I guarantee you, people will pay money for it. It is that good. But you need to seriously shift your strategy because you're not going to make money selling this pro notes feature. It's just not going to happen for you guys.

            "body": "Issues with Messaging Integration, Activation Delay, and macOS Installation\n\nDescription:\nYesterday, the app worked seamlessly with text messaging. Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling.

There is a significant delay between when I tap the hot key to start the program and when it starts to hear, which means I typically try to count to three or four between the Hot key and starting to talk. often I forget. Two, you can't see what you're typing until you click the button again which means you need to retap the hot key every time you want to check what you're writing. Three. On the computer it's hard to tell whether the dictation is on or not so I have often dictated for a while only to realize that all of the work was not recorded. 4. Unlike Microsoft dictation or dragon, you can't alternatively type, and then speak in order to edit or create bullet points etc without constantly needing to hit the hot keys for it to go off and on.",

Right now, each device stores everything locally, and I think having our transcripts synced across all devices would be a game-changer.\n\n**Why this would be useful:**\n\n1. **Access history anywhere** - Being able to view and search through my transcription history on my phone, computer, or any device where I use Wispr Flow would be incredibly convenient.\n2. **Storage concerns** - Local storage is becoming a real issue. My phone already has over 1GB of documents just for the app, and I can’t even imagine how much my computer has accumulated. Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage.\n2. **Backup and peace of mind** - If something happens to one device, I wouldn’t lose all my transcription history.\n\nOf course, I understand this will be implemented as an optional feature that users can opt into if they’re comfortable sharing their transcription data and history with Wispr. That way, users who prioritize privacy can continue using local-only storage while those of us who want the convenience can take advantage of cloud sync.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experiencing similar storage issues or would find this useful!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

At first, I was pretty skeptical, but I really have started using it more and just grabbing it to capture thoughts. \n\nI'd love to have it be a watch app as well, or just sync to there so I don't have to pull out my phone.

Why I turn Flow on from the in-app toggle:\nI have Wispr Flow set to immediately turn off after each message. That means I have to manually tap “Start Flow” every single time I want to speak, which quickly becomes annoying and time-consuming. Turning Flow on from the in-app toggle is my way of trying to keep it active so I don’t have to keep restarting it.\n\n2. What I want it to do:\nWhen I manually toggle Flow on, I expect it to stay active until I either turn it off myself or close the app — regardless of the “immediately turn off” setting. Essentially, the toggle should act as a manual override that keeps Flow running continuously.\n\nSo in short:\n\t•\tThe toggle should override the “immediate turn off” setting.\n\t•\tOnce turned on, Flow should stay active until I manually stop it.",

This works correctly about 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, when I manually toggle Wispr Flow on in the app, it doesn’t stay on persistently. Instead, the first event that would normally trigger an immediate stop causes the microphone to turn off, even though I explicitly enabled it via the toggle.\n\nAdditionally, there appears to be a UI sync issue: when I return to the app after this happens, the toggle still shows as “on” even though the microphone is actually off (confirmed by the indicator in the top left of my screen). The toggle only updates to reflect the true state after I manually turn it off.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nWhen I toggle Wispr Flow on in the app, it should remain active until either:\n\n- I manually toggle it off, or\n- I swipe out of/close the app\n\nThe toggle should override the “immediately turn off” setting while it’s enabled, and the UI state should always accurately reflect whether the microphone is actually active.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Additionally, users expressed frustration with buggy features, connection issues, and a perceived emphasis on marketing rather than addressing user needs."

It only felt fair to give this update since I ripped into them last time around lol\n\nTL;DR, their explanations for the lapse in support seemed fair (caught them in the middle of a customer service transition) and the hiccups with the tool (they were blocked by a whole country lol). Also I didn't enjoy the other providers, they're just missing the oomph...\n\nSo basically, it seems like everything was going wrong for them at the same time for them. That's their explanation, at least which I kind of believe because some of the things seem to be consistent with what my friends were also experiencing. For example, apparently the UAE blocked their server or something, and no one in the country was able to log in, which was actually the root of my disdain. Also did not help that their support was not responsive, their explanation was they'd been changing up the customer service setup during this time. In any case, whether or not that's true, they've been super responsive of late and Im back to it being reliable.\n\nAlso, one last thing I wanted to say, which is also why I'm creating this post, is because what's kind of scary is that I tried all the other providers, and they do not come close to what Wispr Flow is offering. It's just little nuances are missed, it doesn't feel natural. It's scary because if they don't turn things around, Wispr Flow might literally be just monopolizing this whole sector. As it stands, it's pretty good, and my main gripes with them are resolved. So yeah I'm back to recommending them and everything's good again in the universe. ",

When I first got Wisprflow, I thought it was awesome, but it's just gotten so bad recently. has anyone felt the same??\n\nThe app constantly glitches. One minute it works, the next it freezes or disconnects for no reason. I've had it randomly stop during important notes, and sometimes it says it can't connect even though my WiFi is fine.\n\nAlso, it seems to be a really clunky electron app. It's always taking up a massive chunk of my computer's memory and slows everything down. It's extremely resource-intensive, especially given the fact that it's always going to be on in the background.\n\nI've requested for support like a million times, but no one ever responds. I've given up on the product for the past couple of weeks. Recently, I've been looking and exploring some new ones.\n\nI still really like the idea behind it, so I’m looking for something that actually works. Here are some better options I’ve found. When researching these, I specifically only looked for the ones that were built natively for Mac:\n\n**Voice Ink**: Fantastic for people who want control and power-mode switching. One-time payment, local models, and a solid dev support.\n\n**Super whisper**: Best for power users who want full control and unlimited AI processing. Also one-time payment, with local models.\n\n**Willow Voice**: The devs here are amazing. They respond in minutes and fix things quickly. Mac native app. It’s subscription-based, which I don’t love, but it’s the fastest and most accurate dictation tool I’ve used. Formatting for emails is spot on, which I haven’t seen from the others.\n",

Flow pastes clean, unformatted text by default to ensure consistency across apps, which is why Gmail switches back to its default font. A simple workaround is to dictate in another app like Flow Notes, then copy and paste your text into Gmail and apply your preferred font once — that should keep things consistent.\n\nI’ll also share this with our product team to see if we can make Flow more flexible with fonts in the future.

            "body": "Hey folks! 👋\n\nI've been testing **Wispr Flow** for a while now, and honestly, it's become part of my daily workflow. As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

            "body": "Voice dictation has single handedly 2Xed my productivity over the last month! So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?",

I saw the earlier fair‑warning thread on Wispr Flow and the stuff folks raised about big CPU usage, auto‑readding itself to login items and the privacy policy being a bit fuzzy. That’s actually why I ended up building [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) in the first place :-)\n\nOurs is \"hold‑to‑talk\": we only record while you hold a hotkey or mouse button. When you let go, the mic stops and there’s no hidden background process or browser plug‑in. The installer is about 100 MB and CPU usage stays near zero when idle. We also don’t store your audio or transcripts – they stay on your machine, we just stream audio for transcription and then it’s gone.\n\nThis isn’t meant to trash Wispr Flow – they’ve clearly been improving – but if anyone here is still looking for an alternative that’s lightweight and transparent, give [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) a look. I’m a solo founder so all feedback is welcome (even if it’s \"your app sucks\"). [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/)",

It's the antithesis of a native Mac app. The interface is clunky, the menus are slow, and the whole thing feels like a bad web wrapper. I've had better performance from free, open-source tools.\n\nIf you value your battery life and system performance, stay away from Wispr Flow.

When I first got Wisprflow, I thought it was awesome, but it's just gotten so bad recently. has anyone felt the same??\n\nThe app constantly glitches. One minute it works, the next it freezes or disconnects for no reason. I've had it randomly stop during important notes, and sometimes it says it can't connect even though my WiFi is fine.\n\nAlso, it seems to be a really clunky electron app. It's always taking up a massive chunk of my computer's memory and slows everything down. It's extremely resource-intensive, especially given the fact that it's always going to be on in the background.\n\nI've requested for support like a million times, but no one ever responds. I've given up on the product for the past couple of weeks. Recently, I've been looking and exploring some new ones.\n\nI still really like the idea behind it, so I’m looking for something that actually works. Here are some better options I’ve found. When researching these, I specifically only looked for the ones that were built natively for Mac:\n\n**Voice Ink**: Fantastic for people who want control and power-mode switching. One-time payment, local models, and a solid dev support.\n\n**Super whisper**: Best for power users who want full control and unlimited AI processing. Also one-time payment, with local models.\n\n**Willow Voice**: The devs here are amazing. They respond in minutes and fix things quickly. Mac native app. It’s subscription-based, which I don’t love, but it’s the fastest and most accurate dictation tool I’ve used. Formatting for emails is spot on, which I haven’t seen from the others.\n",

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

However, a personal message to the developers and the marketing team. This is a keyboard app. I don't need recurring marketing emails sent to me multiple times after I download the app. I don't need notifications popping up on my phone from this app telling me about your other features. I know you're trying to make it more than a keyboard app, but literally just market to your super consumers. You're a keyboard app that has perfected speech-to-text. It is the best speech-to-text app and keyboard on the App Store by far. We don't need notifications, we don't need marketing emails - like you built a really, really great app, focus on that. Don't annoy your customers with emails and notifications that they don't want because it's just annoying and it really takes away from the great app that you guys built.\n\nIf the purpose of the notifications and email marketing is to drive people to purchase the pro version, just stop. Charge people $3 for the app - one-time purchase, unlimited use. This is the best keyboard app on the market, but you're annoying your customers with all of the notifications and the emails. And you could definitely charge people for this app, and I guarantee you, people will pay money for it. It is that good. But you need to seriously shift your strategy because you're not going to make money selling this pro notes feature. It's just not going to happen for you guys. You built a really great keyboard app, congratulations. Charge people $2, $3, even $5 for it because I guarantee you, word of mouth is going to get around and this app is going to blow up, and you're going to have no one pay for the pro version, and you're going to be stuck with this huge AI bill. If you just charge people a small amount of money up front for unlimited use, you're going to be fine. Please heed my advice.",

That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   \n\nUnfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    \n\nFrustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. \n\nBut I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. \n\nI look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here..",

Developers refuse to address long list of critical bugs. It is unquestionably the worst software application and most miserable User Experience I have ever come across in 20+ years as an Apple user and the team has shown a wanton disregard for addressing these issues it has been plagued with since its initial release. Instead, they have opted to invest all resources in further misleading Apple users with regard to its features and capabilities, charging a $15 subscription fee for negative value delivered. Apple needs to remove Wispr Flow from the App Store permanently.",

They are trying to fill in the gap that Apple has left with Siri and it will work for a little while until Apple either acquires them or improve Siri.\n\nIf the App actually did more than speech to text, I might be willing to pay them monthly.

Spokenly is a solid alternative that can do a lot of what Wispr Flow does—free if you use local models or bring your own API keys. There's also Ito AI, which is basically an open-source copy of Wispr Flow (less powerful, but maybe you don't need \"powerful\" right now). If you need more power and customization there's VoiceInk, Superwhisper (my favorite), and a bunch more.\n\nHonestly, there are A LOT of alternatives.\n\nEDIT. BTW. If you are looking for something that is iOS as well, then your options will be a bit more limited. Wispr Flow/Spokenly/Superwhisper. Out of those three my fav on iOS is Spokenly, but Superwhisper has a new version on Testflight and it's really nice—not sure when will it be released.

You just select the one you want, and it inserts it in line. Bonus points if you can organize them by folders or tags or something. \n\nI know that this is kind of beyond the scope of Wispr Flow because it's a voice app, but it would make it so much easier to recall and bring up different snippets. \n\nOne common use case that I have is not just for coaching links, but for example, I answer a lot of people's questions online, and many times the answer to a question involves a link to one of my YouTube videos. So I have to go now and look up the video, copy the share link, and then paste it in my response. It would be amazing if I could simply say \"my video on such-and-such topic\" and it brings up that URL automatically. \n\nMaybe I am going into rag territory here. This is one idea that I mentioned to you on Twitter a while ago. For example, when I mention in my speech something about coaching link or whatever, something that might match one of my snippets, at the end of dictation it would pop up a menu with suggested snippets to include based on the keywords that I mentioned.",

Storing everything locally adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSecondly, from a history perspective, I personally always go back to my history and either look at what I previously typed to remember what I was working on, or if I lose access to something or accidentally forget where and what I did with something that I typed. It makes it super easy just to go to my transcription history and see exactly what I typed. Thirdly, to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory.\n\nThird of all, I think this opens the door to more personalization. If you store the transcription history, you can use it as training data to make a more custom, fine-tuned model for each user. The transcription in AI Polish is more tailored towards their style, vocabulary, and preferences, making it a more magical experience for the user. I understand that all users may not want this, but for the ones that do, it could be good to have. \n\nAnd finally, yes, I would love to have the ability to search my old notes, maybe for the past week or month. I sometimes have a vague recollection of me previously writing something, and being able to go back and check would be extremely helpful.\n\nFinally, for the mobile-to-desktop users, I think an instant sync would be extremely helpful for everyone who's not on a Mac. Syncing what you have on mobile to desktop is a little difficult. If you could almost recreate that with your app I think it can be really helpful. The way I imagine it is I could voice-type something on my phone and then paste it on my laptop. This could be especially useful in situations where you can't verbally speak to your laptop out loud, but you can quietly whisper into the bottom of your phone.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or follow-ups, please feel free to reach out.",

Additionally, users express disappointment over the absence of features like bulk importing for snippets and dictionaries, and specific modes like \"Gen-Z\" for desktop. Many users are looking for a more personalized experience, indicating the need for greater flexibility and customization capabilities compared to competitor offerings."

One thing I really liked about Willow, though, was its command mode. For example, if you started a dictation with “Hey Willow”, you could then say things like “Compose a message” or “Edit some other text”, and it would carry out those actions.\n\nA workflow I often used was dictating some text, then highlighting it and asking Willow to rewrite it — making it clearer, more formal, or more concise. That functionality was incredibly useful, and I’d love to know if anything like this is on the roadmap for Flow.\n\nI’ve logged well over 300,000 words on Flow so far, and I’d be happy to help beta test these kinds of features, or any other new capabilities you have in the pipeline.",

How did an unstable version even end up on my PC? And most importantly, how can I install a stable version?\n\n\\---  \n  \nThanks for reaching out. My name is Tyler, your AI assistant, and I'm here to help.  \nCommand Mode isn’t working in your Wispr Flow desktop app (version 1.3.454 on darwin/arm64) likely because of:  \n\n\n* **Version Stability:** Version 1.3.454 isn’t a stable release. The stable version is 1.3.424. Using an unstable version can cause issues.\n* **Command Mode Changes:** Command Mode is being updated and may not work reliably right now.\n* **Hotkey Conflicts:** The default shortcut (Fn + Cmd) might clash with system settings or your keyboard. You can change this in Settings → Hotkeys.\n\n**What to do next:**  \n\n\n1. Switch to the stable version (1.3.424): click the Wispr Flow icon in the menu bar → \"Flow version\" → install the update.\n2. Check your subscription is Flow Pro or higher, since Command Mode requires it.\n3. Change the Command Mode shortcut to a less common combo (like Fn + Shift + P) in Settings → Hotkeys.\n4. Avoid starting dictation with phrases like \"Hey, Flow,\" which can trigger Command Mode by mistake.\n5. Quit and restart the app after these changes.\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the issue, it may be due to Command Mode’s experimental status. Please report it using the app’s \"Report an issue\" option in the Flow Hub (under the ? icon).  \n  \nBest,  \nTyler  \nWispr Flow AI Support Agent",

That will stop Flow from interpreting structured phrases like “write an email,” though it may also make formatting less natural in some cases. With Smart Formatting turned off, normal dictation will only record and transcribe. \n\nCan you also confirm whether you’re using [Command Mode](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/8476991260-command-mode) or just normal dictation? That helps us pinpoint what’s triggering the actions. \n\nAs for the Cyrillic text issue, Flow works best when dictating in a single language. Mixed text (like Cyrillic plus English) can cause encoding problems. For now, we suggest:\n\n* Keeping the original message with Cyrillic characters copied somewhere safe before dictating.\n* Avoid giving commands on Cyrillic text.\n* After dictation, paste the original Cyrillic text back in manually to preserve characters.\n\nThis should prevent further corruption while our team looks into improving how different text formats are handled.",

I asked GPT about it, and it said maybe the reason is that Wispr Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard—it only has a number pad and a voice input button. If that’s the case, why not just make it a full keyboard? I don’t get it. For comparison, Spokenly’s iOS version doesn’t have this problem (though it has another one: you can’t even select it in Safari and some native iOS apps).\n\nThe second issue is background permissions. I have to constantly jump back into the app to re-enable mic access, especially when I change input devices (like when I put on headphones).\n\nTo me, these seem like problems that should be relatively easy to solve.

Many users report that despite efforts to designate Wispr Flow as their default keyboard, it fails to remain selected when switching apps, requiring manual reactivation. Additional frustrations arise from poor user experience on iPad, limited keyboard functionality, unexpected shutdowns, and an outdated UI, all contributing to a perception of the keyboard being unreliable and difficult to use."

How did an unstable version even end up on my PC? And most importantly, how can I install a stable version?\n\n\\---  \n  \nThanks for reaching out. My name is Tyler, your AI assistant, and I'm here to help.  \nCommand Mode isn’t working in your Wispr Flow desktop app (version 1.3.454 on darwin/arm64) likely because of:  \n\n\n* **Version Stability:** Version 1.3.454 isn’t a stable release. The stable version is 1.3.424. Using an unstable version can cause issues.\n* **Command Mode Changes:** Command Mode is being updated and may not work reliably right now.\n* **Hotkey Conflicts:** The default shortcut (Fn + Cmd) might clash with system settings or your keyboard. You can change this in Settings → Hotkeys.\n\n**What to do next:**  \n\n\n1. Switch to the stable version (1.3.424): click the Wispr Flow icon in the menu bar → \"Flow version\" → install the update.\n2. Check your subscription is Flow Pro or higher, since Command Mode requires it.\n3. Change the Command Mode shortcut to a less common combo (like Fn + Shift + P) in Settings → Hotkeys.\n4. Avoid starting dictation with phrases like \"Hey, Flow,\" which can trigger Command Mode by mistake.\n5. Quit and restart the app after these changes.\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the issue, it may be due to Command Mode’s experimental status. Please report it using the app’s \"Report an issue\" option in the Flow Hub (under the ? icon).  \n  \nBest,  \nTyler  \nWispr Flow AI Support Agent",

We don't store your audio or transcripts either — audio is sent for transcription and then discarded. It also adapts to different apps (IDEs, terminals, Outlook) and can paste or type into VDI/remote desktops. We have a free tier if you just want to try it.

            "body": "I’ve been using Wispr Flow for about six months. At first, everything was great, but lately the app’s performance on Windows has gotten much worse.\n\nThe biggest problem is that it often freezes, and when it does, it can also freeze whatever app I’m working in. At first, I thought it was the fault of the apps themselves (like having too many browser tabs open), but when Notepad++ started freezing too, it became really irritating.\n\nThis might be related to my use case - I use voice input together with editing and pasting new text. When I’m using Wispr Flow and paste from the clipboard with Ctrl+V, these freezes start happening. Sometimes the cursor even jumps around unexpectedly.\n\nI also use the Windows feature “Clipboard History” (Windows key + V) quite a lot. Another issue is that I often use voice input with languages that have non-Latin scripts, and Wispr Flow completely messes up the copied text in those languages. For example, it records the message I dictated \"I’m talking about Wispr Flow\", then copies the previous message \"Лісьце ў пушчы як цудоўны ложак\", but changes its encoding into something like \"Ë³ñüöå ¢ ïóø÷û ÿê öóäî¢íû ëîæàê\".\n\nThe encoding issue is annoying but tolerable. The freezes, however, are driving me crazy.\n\nHas anyone here used voice input apps for Windows that combine AI with speech recognition? I don’t need commands - just plain text dictation.",

            "body": "I feel like I wasted my money on their annual plan. When I first got Wisprflow, I thought it was awesome, but it's just gotten so bad recently. has anyone felt the same??\n\nThe app constantly glitches. One minute it works, the next it freezes or disconnects for no reason. I've had it randomly stop during important notes, and sometimes it says it can't connect even though my WiFi is fine.\n\nAlso, it seems to be a really clunky electron app. It's always taking up a massive chunk of my computer's memory and slows everything down. It's extremely resource-intensive, especially given the fact that it's always going to be on in the background.\n\nI've requested for support like a million times, but no one ever responds. I've given up on the product for the past couple of weeks. Recently, I've been looking and exploring some new ones.\n\nI still really like the idea behind it, so I’m looking for something that actually works. Here are some better options I’ve found. When researching these, I specifically only looked for the ones that were built natively for Mac:\n\n**Voice Ink**: Fantastic for people who want control and power-mode switching. One-time payment, local models, and a solid dev support.\n\n**Super whisper**: Best for power users who want full control and unlimited AI processing. Also one-time payment, with local models.\n\n**Willow Voice**: The devs here are amazing. They respond in minutes and fix things quickly. Mac native app. It’s subscription-based, which I don’t love, but it’s the fastest and most accurate dictation tool I’ve used. Formatting for emails is spot on, which I haven’t seen from the others.\n",

So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?",

Between job hunting, interviews, and trying to juggle my kid’s schedule, I thought a voice-based tool would finally give me some breathing room. But omg. It keeps butchering what I say. It keeps mishearing things if there’s even a little background noise like I said AWS lambda logs and it typed “Alice’s lamb belongs.” I actually laughed the first time, but then I wanted to throw my phone away the fifth time. It also forgets context constantly, like if I pause for a second, it just loses the thread entirely. And the lag kills me. By the time it processes what I said, I could’ve just typed it myself. I want to love the idea like it’s everything I’ve dreamed of when I’m folding laundry or cooking dinner while thinking through code problems but it’s not there yet. It feels like it’s built for people sitting alone in silent offices, not actual humans with noise, kids, and chaos. I really really want this tech to work, I just wish it worked for the rest of us too.",

Perhaps this is a problem with AirPods, but truly I cannot keep on losing very important transcripts. I'm not always in a perfectly quiet environment. So if I'm just on the go or trying to send someone a message or trying to look up something really quickly, I can't always have 100% perfect silence.\n\nThis needs to be more robust to noise and work better with software/hardware such as AirPods, etc. It also needs to work for longer form content which is in particular an issue on the iOS app, not so much on Mac OS. I don't know if the issue is because after use it for a while it becomes slower because the required inference time or something is an issue. I don't know what it is.

Additionally, the lack of live dictation feedback and previews exacerbates frustration, as users are unable to see their input in real-time, further contributing to inefficiency."

And for those who've never tried Wispr Flow or don't understand what I'm talking about this is what I mean. \n\nWhen I use the apple built-in voice to text and said something like \"hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 4 PM no I'm sorry 3 PM at that new restaurant in downtown Indianapolis I'm sorry Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new talent bench\" It would type it out for word. \n\nHowever, when I use Wispr Flow and say the same thing, it would correct it to \"Hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 3PM at that new restaurant in downtown Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new Talent Bench.\"\n\nI've tried Spokenly, the Apple Wispr app, and one other one that I can't remember, and none of them do that. Is there one that does? \n\nI am 99.9% happy with Wispr Flow. There was a bug like a month ago where it wouldn't catch the first or second word. But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me.

So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful!

            "body": "Tried using Wispr Flow this week because honestly, I am desperate to find something that helps me stay productive without being glued to a screen all day. Between job hunting, interviews, and trying to juggle my kid’s schedule, I thought a voice-based tool would finally give me some breathing room. But omg. It keeps butchering what I say. It keeps mishearing things if there’s even a little background noise like I said AWS lambda logs and it typed “Alice’s lamb belongs.” I actually laughed the first time, but then I wanted to throw my phone away the fifth time. It also forgets context constantly, like if I pause for a second, it just loses the thread entirely. And the lag kills me. By the time it processes what I said, I could’ve just typed it myself. I want to love the idea like it’s everything I’ve dreamed of when I’m folding laundry or cooking dinner while thinking through code problems but it’s not there yet. It feels like it’s built for people sitting alone in silent offices, not actual humans with noise, kids, and chaos. I really really want this tech to work, I just wish it worked for the rest of us too.",

Like it misses a lot of words and sentences. So I just use the built-in microphone on my laptop. And because of this, it makes working in public spaces, especially in a really loud environment, kind of challenging because the microphone is trying to pick up all the distracting noises in the background along with my voice so it sometimes misses a lot of key words or even sentences. \n\nSo I generally try and find a more quiet space and I speak at a more moderate volume.",

I don't know if the issue is because after use it for a while it becomes slower because the required inference time or something is an issue. I don't know what it is.

            "body": "I'm writing this post because I'm genuinely furious. I bought into the hype that Wispr Flow was the next big thing in dictation, especially for Mac users. What I got was a barely-disguised Electron app that runs like a pig. My M2 MacBook Pro, which normally handles my entire dev stack without breaking a sweat, starts spinning up the fans the second I launch this garbage.\n\nIt's supposed to be a seamless, system-wide tool, but it's constantly draining my battery and making my whole system lag. It's the antithesis of a native Mac app. The interface is clunky, the menus are slow, and the whole thing feels like a bad web wrapper. I've had better performance from free, open-source tools.\n\nIf you value your battery life and system performance, stay away from Wispr Flow. It's a prime example of lazy development being sold at a premium price.\n\nHas anyone else noticed how badly this app performs on modern macOS hardware?\n\n\n\n",

Aqua Voice was the first service I subscribed to; its response time is relatively fast at around 400 ms. Its Custom Instructions and Dictionary features are well designed, though Custom Instructions still have some bugs and the Dictionary recognition is occasionally imprecise. Overall, I’d give Aqua Voice a score of about 80.\n\nI recently subscribed to SuperWhisper, which also has a few minor issues. However, because it lets me choose different models, its recognition accuracy is higher. It likewise offers Custom Instructions and a Dictionary, and both are more accurate than those in Aqua Voice. The downside is speed—SuperWhisper’s responses are roughly twice as slow, at about 800 ms.\n\nOverall, even though the slower response time is a drawback, I now use SuperWhisper more often. When I dictate detailed content, accuracy matters more to me than speed.\n\nOne feature I really like is SuperWhisper’s ability to switch between different modes. Whether I’m replying to emails, talking with Claude Code, or chatting with GPT, it can automatically choose the appropriate mode. Thanks to my custom instructions, I can tailor both input and output behaviors, which has greatly improved its usability.",

It keeps mishearing things if there’s even a little background noise like I said AWS lambda logs and it typed “Alice’s lamb belongs.” I actually laughed the first time, but then I wanted to throw my phone away the fifth time. It also forgets context constantly, like if I pause for a second, it just loses the thread entirely. And the lag kills me. By the time it processes what I said, I could’ve just typed it myself. I want to love the idea like it’s everything I’ve dreamed of when I’m folding laundry or cooking dinner while thinking through code problems but it’s not there yet. It feels like it’s built for people sitting alone in silent offices, not actual humans with noise, kids, and chaos.

How did an unstable version even end up on my PC? And most importantly, how can I install a stable version?\n\n\\---  \n  \nThanks for reaching out. My name is Tyler, your AI assistant, and I'm here to help.  \nCommand Mode isn’t working in your Wispr Flow desktop app (version 1.3.454 on darwin/arm64) likely because of:  \n\n\n* **Version Stability:** Version 1.3.454 isn’t a stable release. The stable version is 1.3.424. Using an unstable version can cause issues.\n* **Command Mode Changes:** Command Mode is being updated and may not work reliably right now.\n* **Hotkey Conflicts:** The default shortcut (Fn + Cmd) might clash with system settings or your keyboard. You can change this in Settings → Hotkeys.\n\n**What to do next:**  \n\n\n1. Switch to the stable version (1.3.424): click the Wispr Flow icon in the menu bar → \"Flow version\" → install the update.\n2. Check your subscription is Flow Pro or higher, since Command Mode requires it.\n3. Change the Command Mode shortcut to a less common combo (like Fn + Shift + P) in Settings → Hotkeys.\n4. Avoid starting dictation with phrases like \"Hey, Flow,\" which can trigger Command Mode by mistake.\n5. Quit and restart the app after these changes.\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the issue, it may be due to Command Mode’s experimental status. Please report it using the app’s \"Report an issue\" option in the Flow Hub (under the ? icon).  \n  \nBest,  \nTyler  \nWispr Flow AI Support Agent",

That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   \n\nUnfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    \n\nFrustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. \n\nBut I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. \n\nI look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here..",

Like, when you're opening the keyboard, it has to open the Wispr app and then will go back to the app you're on. Sometimes this is buggy, and it's pretty frustrating as it happens probably one out of four times you use it if not more. Also, the app signifies in the floating island that the microphone is always being used even when the keyboard is not actively on. This has interference with Hey Siri which is annoying. I wish they could get this better figured out. The desktop experience is so much better.",

This works correctly about 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, when I manually toggle Wispr Flow on in the app, it doesn’t stay on persistently. Instead, the first event that would normally trigger an immediate stop causes the microphone to turn off, even though I explicitly enabled it via the toggle.\n\nAdditionally, there appears to be a UI sync issue: when I return to the app after this happens, the toggle still shows as “on” even though the microphone is actually off (confirmed by the indicator in the top left of my screen). The toggle only updates to reflect the true state after I manually turn it off.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nWhen I toggle Wispr Flow on in the app, it should remain active until either:\n\n- I manually toggle it off, or\n- I swipe out of/close the app\n\nThe toggle should override the “immediately turn off” setting while it’s enabled, and the UI state should always accurately reflect whether the microphone is actually active.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

How did an unstable version even end up on my PC? And most importantly, how can I install a stable version?\n\n\\---  \n  \nThanks for reaching out. My name is Tyler, your AI assistant, and I'm here to help.  \nCommand Mode isn’t working in your Wispr Flow desktop app (version 1.3.454 on darwin/arm64) likely because of:  \n\n\n* **Version Stability:** Version 1.3.454 isn’t a stable release. The stable version is 1.3.424. Using an unstable version can cause issues.\n* **Command Mode Changes:** Command Mode is being updated and may not work reliably right now.\n* **Hotkey Conflicts:** The default shortcut (Fn + Cmd) might clash with system settings or your keyboard. You can change this in Settings → Hotkeys.\n\n**What to do next:**  \n\n\n1. Switch to the stable version (1.3.424): click the Wispr Flow icon in the menu bar → \"Flow version\" → install the update.\n2. Check your subscription is Flow Pro or higher, since Command Mode requires it.\n3. Change the Command Mode shortcut to a less common combo (like Fn + Shift + P) in Settings → Hotkeys.\n4. Avoid starting dictation with phrases like \"Hey, Flow,\" which can trigger Command Mode by mistake.\n5. Quit and restart the app after these changes.\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the issue, it may be due to Command Mode’s experimental status. Please report it using the app’s \"Report an issue\" option in the Flow Hub (under the ? icon).  \n  \nBest,  \nTyler  \nWispr Flow AI Support Agent",

Additionally, issues with student discounts and persistent bugs related to trial periods are frequently mentioned, contributing to overall dissatisfaction with the service."

The Mac version is excellent, but the iOS version really confuses me.\n\nThe first issue is that I can’t set it as the default keyboard. I’ve already moved it to the top in the iOS keyboard settings (so technically it should be the default), but every time I switch apps, I still have to manually bring it up again, which is super annoying. I asked GPT about it, and it said maybe the reason is that Wispr Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard—it only has a number pad and a voice input button. If that’s the case, why not just make it a full keyboard? I don’t get it. For comparison, Spokenly’s iOS version doesn’t have this problem (though it has another one: you can’t even select it in Safari and some native iOS apps).\n\nThe second issue is background permissions. I have to constantly jump back into the app to re-enable mic access, especially when I change input devices (like when I put on headphones).\n\nTo me, these seem like problems that should be relatively easy to solve.

That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   \n\nUnfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    \n\nFrustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. \n\nBut I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. \n\nI look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here..",

Like, when you're opening the keyboard, it has to open the Wispr app and then will go back to the app you're on. Sometimes this is buggy, and it's pretty frustrating as it happens probably one out of four times you use it if not more. Also, the app signifies in the floating island that the microphone is always being used even when the keyboard is not actively on. This has interference with Hey Siri which is annoying. I wish they could get this better figured out. The desktop experience is so much better.",

Additionally, some users seek clarity on available settings to manage microphone activity, indicating a lack of intuitive controls within the app."

So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful!

What I got was a barely-disguised Electron app that runs like a pig. My M2 MacBook Pro, which normally handles my entire dev stack without breaking a sweat, starts spinning up the fans the second I launch this garbage.\n\nIt's supposed to be a seamless, system-wide tool, but it's constantly draining my battery and making my whole system lag. It's the antithesis of a native Mac app. The interface is clunky, the menus are slow, and the whole thing feels like a bad web wrapper. I've had better performance from free, open-source tools.\n\nIf you value your battery life and system performance, stay away from Wispr Flow. It's a prime example of lazy development being sold at a premium price.\n\nHas anyone else noticed how badly this app performs on modern macOS hardware?\n\n\n\n",

I saw the earlier fair‑warning thread on Wispr Flow and the stuff folks raised about big CPU usage, auto‑readding itself to login items and the privacy policy being a bit fuzzy. That’s actually why I ended up building [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) in the first place :-)\n\nOurs is \"hold‑to‑talk\": we only record while you hold a hotkey or mouse button. When you let go, the mic stops and there’s no hidden background process or browser plug‑in. The installer is about 100 MB and CPU usage stays near zero when idle. We also don’t store your audio or transcripts – they stay on your machine, we just stream audio for transcription and then it’s gone.\n\nThis isn’t meant to trash Wispr Flow – they’ve clearly been improving – but if anyone here is still looking for an alternative that’s lightweight and transparent, give [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) a look. I’m a solo founder so all feedback is welcome (even if it’s \"your app sucks\"). [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/)",

When I first got Wisprflow, I thought it was awesome, but it's just gotten so bad recently. has anyone felt the same??\n\nThe app constantly glitches. One minute it works, the next it freezes or disconnects for no reason. I've had it randomly stop during important notes, and sometimes it says it can't connect even though my WiFi is fine.\n\nAlso, it seems to be a really clunky electron app. It's always taking up a massive chunk of my computer's memory and slows everything down. It's extremely resource-intensive, especially given the fact that it's always going to be on in the background.\n\nI've requested for support like a million times, but no one ever responds. I've given up on the product for the past couple of weeks. Recently, I've been looking and exploring some new ones.\n\nI still really like the idea behind it, so I’m looking for something that actually works. Here are some better options I’ve found. When researching these, I specifically only looked for the ones that were built natively for Mac:\n\n**Voice Ink**: Fantastic for people who want control and power-mode switching. One-time payment, local models, and a solid dev support.\n\n**Super whisper**: Best for power users who want full control and unlimited AI processing. Also one-time payment, with local models.\n\n**Willow Voice**: The devs here are amazing. They respond in minutes and fix things quickly. Mac native app. It’s subscription-based, which I don’t love, but it’s the fastest and most accurate dictation tool I’ve used. Formatting for emails is spot on, which I haven’t seen from the others.\n",

So I would have to put my phone up near my mouth and whisper if I need to send a quick text message or email somebody or take some notes, etc. So for me anyways, Because of the way I set it up, it never uses the AirPods microphone.\n\nAs for using it on the laptop, I don't know why but my AirPods microphone don't pick up too well and it doesn't  work too well with wispr flow. Like it misses a lot of words and sentences. So I just use the built-in microphone on my laptop. And because of this, it makes working in public spaces, especially in a really loud environment, kind of challenging because the microphone is trying to pick up all the distracting noises in the background along with my voice so it sometimes misses a lot of key words or even sentences. \n\nSo I generally try and find a more quiet space and I speak at a more moderate volume.",

            "body": "I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

For Spokenly, you only pay if you want to use their online cloud services, but using it locally and or using your own API key is much cheaper and oftentimes free. \n\nSo why should I choose wispr flow over something like Spokenly?

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

Yes.\n\nIt really depends on what you need and whether you're more technical and like dealing with prompts and settings/need customization. Spokenly is a solid alternative that can do a lot of what Wispr Flow does—free if you use local models or bring your own API keys. There's also Ito AI, which is basically an open-source copy of Wispr Flow (less powerful, but maybe you don't need \"powerful\" right now). If you need more power and customization there's VoiceInk, Superwhisper (my favorite), and a bunch more.\n\nHonestly, there are A LOT of alternatives.\n\nEDIT. BTW. If you are looking for something that is iOS as well, then your options will be a bit more limited. Wispr Flow/Spokenly/Superwhisper. Out of those three my fav on iOS is Spokenly, but Superwhisper has a new version on Testflight and it's really nice—not sure when will it be released. There's also VoiceInk for iOS but last I tried it was too buggy, perhaps it's better now.",

I believe they have launched new AI offline models that provide much faster and more accurate output.\n\nAs we speak, I am trying both applications together — Wispr Flow and Super Whisper — and I find Super Whisper a tad faster with the current AI model that I'm using, and it is offline. I can use this anywhere, anytime without an internet connection. If you want a quick and accurate response, I suggest exploring the new offline AI models, which have about a 10/10 response time and around 8/10 accuracy. I am using the Parakeet English AI Model.",

Overall, the absence of these features in Wispr Flow leads users to seek alternatives that provide faster performance and greater flexibility."

            "body": "Issues with Messaging Integration, Activation Delay, and macOS Installation\n\nDescription:\nYesterday, the app worked seamlessly with text messaging. Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

Many users report an excessive number of steps, repeated prompts to activate features, and issues with installation and access settings on macOS. Additionally, the onboarding wizard fails to recognize completed tasks, and users are unable to skip or exit the onboarding flow, leading to a tedious and confusing experience that needs improvement."

            "body": "So here was my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1ncpjhm/wispr_flow_has_turned_into_total_garbage_dumpster/) nearly a month ago and I have to say they've rebuilt and possibly surpassed the trust the I had with them earlier. It only felt fair to give this update since I ripped into them last time around lol\n\nTL;DR, their explanations for the lapse in support seemed fair (caught them in the middle of a customer service transition) and the hiccups with the tool (they were blocked by a whole country lol). Also I didn't enjoy the other providers, they're just missing the oomph...\n\nSo basically, it seems like everything was going wrong for them at the same time for them. That's their explanation, at least which I kind of believe because some of the things seem to be consistent with what my friends were also experiencing. For example, apparently the UAE blocked their server or something, and no one in the country was able to log in, which was actually the root of my disdain. Also did not help that their support was not responsive, their explanation was they'd been changing up the customer service setup during this time. In any case, whether or not that's true, they've been super responsive of late and Im back to it being reliable.\n\nAlso, one last thing I wanted to say, which is also why I'm creating this post, is because what's kind of scary is that I tried all the other providers, and they do not come close to what Wispr Flow is offering. It's just little nuances are missed, it doesn't feel natural. It's scary because if they don't turn things around, Wispr Flow might literally be just monopolizing this whole sector. As it stands, it's pretty good, and my main gripes with them are resolved. So yeah I'm back to recommending them and everything's good again in the universe. ",

            "body": "I’ve been using Wispr Flow for about six months. At first, everything was great, but lately the app’s performance on Windows has gotten much worse.\n\nThe biggest problem is that it often freezes, and when it does, it can also freeze whatever app I’m working in. At first, I thought it was the fault of the apps themselves (like having too many browser tabs open), but when Notepad++ started freezing too, it became really irritating.\n\nThis might be related to my use case - I use voice input together with editing and pasting new text. When I’m using Wispr Flow and paste from the clipboard with Ctrl+V, these freezes start happening. Sometimes the cursor even jumps around unexpectedly.\n\nI also use the Windows feature “Clipboard History” (Windows key + V) quite a lot. Another issue is that I often use voice input with languages that have non-Latin scripts, and Wispr Flow completely messes up the copied text in those languages. For example, it records the message I dictated \"I’m talking about Wispr Flow\", then copies the previous message \"Лісьце ў пушчы як цудоўны ложак\", but changes its encoding into something like \"Ë³ñüöå ¢ ïóø÷û ÿê öóäî¢íû ëîæàê\".\n\nThe encoding issue is annoying but tolerable. The freezes, however, are driving me crazy.\n\nHas anyone here used voice input apps for Windows that combine AI with speech recognition? I don’t need commands - just plain text dictation.",

When you push the button to dictate in French and then stop, push again to switch to English, there are still many recognition problems with your tool. (it translate in french in place of english)\n\nIt's t the international level that you face the most significant challenges, but this also presents an opportunity to differentiate yourself from competitors if you are able to fix this main issue. \n\nAn alternative solution we've discussed involves using one different shortcut per language.",

That will stop Flow from interpreting structured phrases like “write an email,” though it may also make formatting less natural in some cases. With Smart Formatting turned off, normal dictation will only record and transcribe. \n\nCan you also confirm whether you’re using [Command Mode](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/8476991260-command-mode) or just normal dictation? That helps us pinpoint what’s triggering the actions. \n\nAs for the Cyrillic text issue, Flow works best when dictating in a single language. Mixed text (like Cyrillic plus English) can cause encoding problems. For now, we suggest:\n\n* Keeping the original message with Cyrillic characters copied somewhere safe before dictating.\n* Avoid giving commands on Cyrillic text.\n* After dictation, paste the original Cyrillic text back in manually to preserve characters.\n\nThis should prevent further corruption while our team looks into improving how different text formats are handled.",

However, in my view, it’s the wrong approach to prioritize promotion over user intention. The goal should be to make it as easy as possible for users to provide feedback and suggest improvements. A great product generates visibility on its own — satisfied users will happily share their experiences.\n\nRemember your customer: The perfect tool should save time and effort. We are highly efficient people who want to save time and work as effectively as possible in general. Having to create a Reddit account just to give feedback on another tool and searching for subreddits, while reading each one to find the one with the same intent, feels like an unnecessary hurdle. I am absolutely against the idea of using Wispr in this manner.\n\nIn the end, this unfortunately comes across as yet another unconventional path Wispr is taking — one that risks slowing things down rather than accelerating growth. On top of that, Reddit offers weaker structure and discoverability for such matters (which might be a reason tools like Canny exist). There’s no roadmap transparency, and if activity really does scale, things will quickly become completely unmanageable.\n\nI use Wispr because it's really fast, but other tools are emerging quickly, and they have features I absolutely miss in Wispr.

            "body": "Hey Wispr Flow team and community!\n\nI’d love to see cloud sync functionality added for our transcription history. Right now, each device stores everything locally, and I think having our transcripts synced across all devices would be a game-changer.\n\n**Why this would be useful:**\n\n1. **Access history anywhere** - Being able to view and search through my transcription history on my phone, computer, or any device where I use Wispr Flow would be incredibly convenient.\n2. **Storage concerns** - Local storage is becoming a real issue. My phone already has over 1GB of documents just for the app, and I can’t even imagine how much my computer has accumulated. Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage.\n2. **Backup and peace of mind** - If something happens to one device, I wouldn’t lose all my transcription history.\n\nOf course, I understand this will be implemented as an optional feature that users can opt into if they’re comfortable sharing their transcription data and history with Wispr. That way, users who prioritize privacy can continue using local-only storage while those of us who want the convenience can take advantage of cloud sync.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experiencing similar storage issues or would find this useful!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Even when I disable Smart Formatting, the text is not transcribed word-for-word as I dictate it; instead, an AI alters it. This is noticeable because the app is no longer as fast as when AI Formatting is disabled. There is a noticeable delay caused by AI Formatting. This delay is another factor that makes the application unattractive. Because of the forced delay introduced by the AI Formatting, the app is now sometimes even slower than other speech-to-text applications, particularly those using the Groq API.",

However, in my view, it’s the wrong approach to prioritize promotion over user intention. The goal should be to make it as easy as possible for users to provide feedback and suggest improvements. A great product generates visibility on its own — satisfied users will happily share their experiences.\n\nRemember your customer: The perfect tool should save time and effort. We are highly efficient people who want to save time and work as effectively as possible in general. Having to create a Reddit account just to give feedback on another tool and searching for subreddits, while reading each one to find the one with the same intent, feels like an unnecessary hurdle. I am absolutely against the idea of using Wispr in this manner.\n\nIn the end, this unfortunately comes across as yet another unconventional path Wispr is taking — one that risks slowing things down rather than accelerating growth. On top of that, Reddit offers weaker structure and discoverability for such matters (which might be a reason tools like Canny exist). There’s no roadmap transparency, and if activity really does scale, things will quickly become completely unmanageable.\n\nI use Wispr because it's really fast, but other tools are emerging quickly, and they have features I absolutely miss in Wispr. I hope you will be ahead in that race.",

            "body": "Issues with Messaging Integration, Activation Delay, and macOS Installation\n\nDescription:\nYesterday, the app worked seamlessly with text messaging. Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

There is a significant delay between when I tap the hot key to start the program and when it starts to hear, which means I typically try to count to three or four between the Hot key and starting to talk. often I forget.

On the computer it's hard to tell whether the dictation is on or not so I have often dictated for a while only to realize that all of the work was not recorded. 4.
