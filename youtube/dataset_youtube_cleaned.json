We cast Timothy Shalomé to talk about our amazing features like auto edits. Where are we going to get Timothy Shalomé? Our meeting is in 10. Never mind 9 minutes. What other features can we show them? With Whisper Flow, you can save unique words or names to your own personalized dictionary. Yo, what's up, broki? Teddy Roosevelt. Broacho. And with Whisper Flow, you don't need to say punctuation like, \"Hey, period. Where are you?\" Right? You could just say, \"Where are you?\" Wait, where are you? Uh, sorry. I get a little nervous before pitches. I got it. What if we pitch whisper flow commercial where two people are coming up with a commercial for whisper flow? They can talk about how flow works inside Slack, iMessage, email, docs or anything really. So what do you think? It is way too meta. They are never going to go for it. We're pitching to Whisper Flow and we don't have any ideas. Wow. Okay. So they went for it. Whisper Flow now available on mobile."

        "srt": "There's one AI tool that I genuinely cannot live without, and that has brought me at least three times productivity gains and actually helps me code at least three times faster. Now, the tool that I'm talking about here is called Whisper Flow, whereas I'm going to refer to it for the rest of the video flow. Now simply put, this is a dictation tool. It lets me type by speaking into my microphone. Now you might think, okay, that's not revolutionary, right? We have like dictation all the time. We've had that for, you know, ten plus years, but this is significantly different. And just simply put, it is a way better dictation tool than any tool that I've ever used, which is extremely important when you're using it. You know, thousands of words every single day. So let me show you a quick demo of how it works. And I want to dive into the features and essentially convince you to start using this. Because when I started using it, my productivity just massively skyrocketed and almost every single application. And full disclosure here, I'm really fortunate that I was able to team up with flow for this video. I was actually using them long before they reached out to do a partnership, but now they're sponsor of this channel, which is fantastic because I use them anyways. Point is, let me show you how this works. Okay, so I'm in ChatGPT. I've got flow running. You can see that by this little kind of icon in the bottom which is transparent. If you click it, it starts dictating. And then you can right click it and you'll get a few settings as well. Works on windows, Mac, etc.. Okay. Now what I can do is use a key bind on my computer, which is what I prefer. In my case, it's the control windows key and then I can start talking. So let's do something like this. Hey ChatGPT, I'm just giving a quick example of how I talk into the computer and why this is so much faster than typing, and how this is a better dictation tool than built in dictation. And here we go. You see that? I get everything here. Now, the interesting thing is that this automatically fixes my grammar. It will actually list things out in point form. It works directly inside of tools like cursor, windsurf, AI editors. It can tag files. It works in WhatsApp. It works in disk or just anywhere you need to type. This thing works and it works better. For example, and I know this isn't going to seem super impressive, but it's a big deal when you use this a lot. Watch what happens when I list something out. I have a grocery list. I need to collect apples, pears, bananas, strawberries, and other miscellaneous fruit. And notice that it actually puts it like with the dashes correctly puts the colon. Doesn't just dictate what I'm saying. It actually uses AI to generate the correct transcription on what I'm trying to say. Even if I do something like I'm not really sure. Like what? I'm kind of trying to think about, and you see that it removes all of those filler words except for the ones that I'm intentionally putting here. So if you're fumbling your words, are you saying something incorrectly? It automatically fixes that for you. Now that's just me going kind of on and on here about why this is really good, but I want to explain why this makes me code three times faster. So I just open up the flow settings here. The way I got there is I went to the indicator and I just want to go to settings. And it brought me to this page. Now I'm rarely in this page, but the one thing that I wanted to show you is my stats. Just to prove to you why I can code significantly faster. So see how it says 202 words per minute and that's obviously top 1% of all flow users. You may not speak as quickly as I do, but I can only type at realistically, maybe 60 to 70 words per minute. And I'm not 100% accurate. I make mistakes, and especially when I'm prompting, I find that I type even a little bit slower because I have to think more carefully, and then I have to kind of remember what I thought about and type it into the computer. But with flow, I can just stream my consciousness directly into all of these alarms, and I don't lose any of my immediate thoughts. Now, in practice with this allows me to do is not just get more words into the AI faster, but to actually provide more details in context that I honestly probably would not have written if I had to actually manually type it out. So I'm going to show you an example now by diving into my code editor, so you can see how I use it there. But a few quick features to note. Obviously you've got the stats. I think that's cool. And then you have all of the previous transcriptions, right? So I can't really show all of them because it is sensitive information. But for example, a lot of times when I use previous dictation tools, either they don't work or they only get half of what I'm saying, or they mess it up, or the app randomly crashes. And now my transcription that I spent, you know, five minutes speaking is completely gone here. It tracks all of it. And I do actually come to this pretty often, especially when an app crashes or I have to refresh the page or something and I lose the previous all of them response, so I can just copy the transcription that I used. There's notes, there's snippets, there's actually variable tagging and stuff, which I'll show you. But for now let's hop into the code editor, because you guys are developers and that's overall what you care about. Okay, so let's say I'm here inside of cursor right now. I could do something like, hey, can you change the name of my application to be, you know, dev launch Vault? Okay. So I can do that. And that took I don't know, you guys can tell me 11 seconds, 12 seconds, etc., but I can speak pretty fast, right? So watch as I go to flow. Hey, can you change the name of my application to be Dev Launch Vault and it'll pick it up and boom, it puts it in there, I think probably about 2 to 3 times faster than if I was actually typing it again, even with the correct grammar. And it's able to determine kind of what I'm meeting now. That's fine. That's just a simple example. However, you can actually directly reference variables, files and use this with more context inside of cursor. So just for an example I've gone to this. And what you get sections. And this has a bunch of kind of features that you get in this new product landing page that I'm working on. It's the dev launch resource fault. Anyways, I could obviously manually add one, right? You know, I could copy it, I could paste it, I could manually write what the new title is, what the new description is, I can maybe use like the autocomplete directly inside of here. Or I could go, you know, and I could prompt it out and ask it what I want. Additionally, I could just use flow, which is what I use now pretty much all the time. So let me show you how this works and how it actually tags the correct files. So I'm going to say this. Can you please go inside of the what you get section file and add additional features? I need features that sound unique that are not repetitive and that will help sell this product. I want you to brainstorm a few different ideas, share them with me, and then get approval from me. Before you start making the modifications inside of that file. Again, make sure they're unique to the point, not repetitive, and help sell the product, but also are accurate based on what you know about the product and what you see on the landing page. So far. Okay, and wait a second here. And you can see that it automatically actually tags the file for me and adds the context. So this is a feature that's built into flow, right? It can just figure out what the file is. You can see it gives me all of the grammar and the punctuation. It's extremely fast. And then we can run the prompt and we can just wait for it to actually kind of do this. And let's see if it works. All right. So we got the output here. Obviously I could continue going along that path. But I want to show you a few other things that I do here typically with flow. So as well as referencing files it is able to reference variables and actually use pre-built snippets. So for example you may have a command they use all the time that you don't want to actually read out. In that case, you could use flow to set that up. So let me show you how that works. So if I just open up the settings here, you can see that I've created this snippet. I had to delete my other ones because they have a lot of personal data that again I can't share. But I called the snippet docker run. So the way you do this, you add new, you give some name, and then you give what you want the expansion to be. You can also share this with the team if you have those team features enabled. And in my case, it's like a pretty long, complex docker command that I probably don't want to speak out into the computer. So now what I can do is I can just go here, I can say docker run. And then when I do that, it just automatically kind of feels that in with the snippet. So you could do this for an email in my case for coding, I'll do it for, you know, long commands or long snippets that I need to copy a lot. And then rather than having like a notepad with all these snippets and I'm copying and pasting them or using the windows like, what do you call it? Clipboard, where you can have multiple paste files and stuff. I just can use my voice, which is significantly better. So I can say, hey, can you analyze this command docker run? And then when I do that, it just directly puts the command inside of here. Right. And then I could put enter and it can start analyzing it. And you guys can obviously see the value in having these pre-built snippets. So obviously outside of coding there's a lot of use cases for this as well. For me, I just use it everywhere in pretty much any application wherever my cursor is accessible, because that's how it works. And I want to explain why I would even use this in something like WhatsApp or discord, as opposed to a normal voice message. Now, a voice message is fine. It's a quick way to convey information, but you kind of put the onus on someone else to listen to that message. I know a lot of times when people send me a voice message, it means I essentially need to stop, think, pause and listen to it. And I don't have the written version, so I can't skim it, see if it's important, and I have to trust that they're not going to waste my time with, like, you know, a five minute long voice message. So in my opinion, it's always a little bit more respectful to send a text message that someone can decide if they want to read or not by just skimming through it. So that's typically what I prefer to do. But I'll even show you that if I were to use a built in dictation tool or voice mode like the one here in ChatGPT, you don't get nearly as good of a result. Hey, send a message to my girlfriend Mae and tell her to go to the store and pick up apples, bananas, pears, blueberries, and other snack food also. Then send a message to my mom and tell her that Whisper Flow is a pretty cool tool to be using. Okay? And then we stop. It already takes significantly longer to actually come up with the dictation. And you can see here the first of all, it says Mae, that's not how you spell my girlfriend's name. I'm going to show you in a second. You can see whisper flow. Is this one word? It's spelled incorrectly, right? And just overall, the dictation is not as good. Now, if I go here, let's do the same thing. Hey, send a message to my girlfriend Mae, and tell her to go to the store and pick up apples, bananas, pears, blueberries, and other snack food also. Then send a message to my mom and tell her that Whisper Flow is a pretty cool tool to be using. Okay, we can see that significantly faster. It picks up the message, puts it in a list format as we expected it. Notice it uses the correct spelling for my girlfriend's name. Now how does it do that? Well, because as soon as you correct anything inside of here. So if you do a dictation and then it's Ted Mae, for example, and you switched it back to Mae, then whispered to text that there's a special vocabulary that you have and uses that in the future. Now to prove that to you. Right. Like, I can go here and you can see that there's two words that's picked up recently. Again, I had it had to delete a lot of them because they're personal. But we have Mae. Mae Lowe automatically detected that this is a word in my vocabulary, and it should use that instead of the standard spelling of the name Mae. And then same thing with meta. Previously it was giving me like meta and then it corrected it to be normal meta, which is obviously how you spell that, you know, relating to Facebook. So I'm just trying to show you that, yes, there is a difference between the built in dictation or the voice modes, and there's a reason why I use this and why I'm promoting it, because it genuinely is just better and lets me code significantly faster. And there are tons of other settings you can go and mess with here. Like you have notes, right? You can add your own notes. Personally, I don't really use that feature. You know, generally speaking though, just the dictation is kind of the winner here. And the fact that it works very well inside of tools like cursor and windsurf. If you guys want to check it out, try from the link in the description. I know of course there's sponsor, but genuinely I'm excited about this because I use it all the time and I'm trying to encourage more people to use voice and be more productive. And I really see this as the future of really coding and just productivity in general speaking, rather than having to manually type everything, which is just significantly slower."

        "srt": "I more and more voice dictate the text. No matter if I'm coding, no matter if I'm taking notes or if I'm answering you guys inside the membership, I'm using my voice in order to do this. And there are new updates that allow me to get even faster. But when we talk about being fast and faster than typing, I want to start this video by looking at my statistics right here. So you see my average speed when I talk converting it into typing it's 125 words per minute which is the top 2% of the flow users. Okay you see I already have written 76,000 words. Now they added something that makes it even faster to write and I will show you in a moment what this means. But first of all, I want to show you this as I was curious asking perplexity who is the fastest typer in English. And the fastest typer was found to have 305 words per minute for 15 seconds. So we're not talking about a full script or something like that. When we look at the Guinness World Record for fastest typing, sustaining 212 words per minute. Okay, that's all not so far away from the 125 words per minute I told you. However, the key here to keep in mind is these speeds are extreme outliers with most professional typists typing at 65 to 75 words per minute and average people around 41 words per minute. So, you see this is three times as fast as the average person is typing. And I'm pretty sure people who are not typing with all their fingers and you know blindly typing as I already do. So, I'm a fast typer. I realize I'm even faster with voice. Today, I want to talk about a feature that they added in Whisper Flow that makes it even faster, which is called snippets. So, now I'm able to say some trigger words that get replaced then by the information that I provide. So, for example, here if I say add YouTube link, it will add this link to the YouTube channel. Okay, let's test this in action. Do you know what I core or the paperless movement is all about? So now you see already it's not only writing it out but it also adds the register mark for the paperless movement. And this is happening because in the snippets we have now here if whenever I say I core it should add these versions and in the vocabulary I always know that I have some pronunciation issues. It seems it never gets it right but now it gets it right as I can now pick up the things that don't work. And now you see also there are stars. If I directly correct the text afterwards, it recognizes this and updates the words inside my vocabulary too. So based on this, I can now make the snippets. And now you see if I say I it should add the registration mark and here too. Or if I say let's eye add these emojis and so on. So I can really do interesting things here. So let's test this again. If you want to learn more about ICO, let's have a call and just book a call on this link. Insert discovery call link. Here we go. If you want to learn more about ICO, let's have a call. Book a call on this link. And it added the link accordingly. So even if there are typos in there or anything that I need to change, we have to consider when I'm typing this out, I'm many times using backspace in order to correct what I have written before. So it's not even an issue correcting it. And if it got it wrong and I correct it, AI recognizes this and adds it to the vocabulary. So I think there is an amazing potential behind this. I also even use it on my phone as they have now a mobile app. Here you go. There are other alternatives out there. I just think in general this is a whole new level of AI voice transcription. I know there have been options out there already to use the dictation tool when you write a message inside WhatsApp or iMessage or whatever. However, they never seem so accurate. And here AI is much smarter to make a real transcription that makes sense. So if I misspelled something, if I correct myself, it recognizes these things and automatically removes it from the final result. And a good thing is it always saves it inside the app. So if I lose it somewhere or I want to use the text again, I can always go back into the app to find it. So I think that's an amazing thing. I just want to share with you. I'm curious how many of you watching are already using AI voice transcription to speed up productivity. Let me know in the comments below. And if you're curious to test it out, also let's talk in the comments below what your thoughts are about using these types of AI. I think that's an area where AI can really shine and help us really to become more productive. So, if you agree with this, give it a thumbs up, share with your friends, and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already, so I can catch you up in the next"

        "srt": "so this is just a quick experiment with a tool that I've been using recently called whisper flow so this allows you to speak to type I'm not a very fast typer however this tool allows me to speak and type in different languages and get to speeds of around 145 words per minute which is not something I'd be able to do if I was typing normally um I find it quite an effective tool I think the language options are really good with that as well I'll just show you an example from a language um way of doing [Music] things as you can see it writes out the text perfectly in another language it adds the things like the question marks the gr uh the spacing and things like that so if you're writing an email or something else with the to as well I found it very effective because it allows you to just say what you're writing and it'll put things into the way um however the example that I wanted to use for here is to see if I could use Reit which is another great tool for building AI or building applications using code and also doing it um just through prompting so what i' do is merge both together and see if I can build an application without actually typing or using the keyboard can you build me an application similar to Trello where users can add new cards and can drag and drop them into list I'd like this into an agile methodology so we've got things like the backlog we've got the to-do items we've got in progress and we've got completed there already ready to sign off and could you create this very similar but with a very good user interface that's easy to use and something that people will enjoy working with again it's it's created all of that I can literally just press the enter key so I did have to use the keyboard um and let's see what it comes up with okay so few options here let's let's go for all of them yes the board is displaying properly we have all the items on there good work create a new card labels let's see if we can um this is a test card welcome this is our first card yes this is working correctly I can create a new card I can add a title a description I can add whether it's uh the priority of the card and what type of um information it is whether it's enhancement feature or bug the only thing that's not working just yet is the create card button right let's try again this is a test card welcome this is our first test Card unfortunately the great card button doesn't seem to do anything this is a test card welcome this is our first test card perfect yes you can now create a card the only you can't do at the moment is drag and drop yes the priority badge is showing however they don't have colors the labels are visible on the card you can edit the priority and everything looks good however you cannot drag and drop still notice I hadn't tested the priority this is an extra line on the description hyphen this is more information okay so you can have more than one that's great even design okay yeah that makes sense so the only thing that's not working is the dragon drop that's fine let's see if it can fix that oh I forgot to tell it the priority colors are working this is a new card we're just doing a new card to see if the drag and drop functionality works works I'll take a screenshot of that this is the era that I'm getting when I try to drag and drop the dragon drop doesn't work everything else is working fine now nope I'm sorry to say but you still can't drag and drop unfortunately sometimes it does get stuck on things like this um however it's quite impressive what the tool can do so not too worried at this stage least we know that the developers are still in work for a few years to come nope I'm sorry to say that the drag and drop function doesn't work is there an alternative way we can look at doing this like in the edit of the item we can change it to another column as you can see the whisper flow comes up with the text perfectly it's far quicker than I could ever write sometimes issues like this look like it might be that they haven't defined the the boards and just static information on the page so it might actually fix the other issue in this meantime okay unfortunately a dragon drop still not an option but we can now change it manually perfect yes thank you that does get us over the problem I'm sure you could fix a dragon drop issue if you try a different approach on trying to do it see what you can come up with something different from what you've done already as that doesn't appear to be working I know you can do it so from research and information I've read apparently if you are very positive speaking when prompting you can also get different responses also what I've done there is tried to say let's try this in a different approach so it doesn't just continue trying to do the same thing and iterating over the same code that it's continually done in previous versions we know that we've got over the issue one of the biggest things in software development is solving problems not just fixing the fixing the thing that's there let's see if there's an alternative way around it even if it's not 100% ideal we can then always come back to the problem again but at least we've got a solution to building the product it looks like it might be using different libraries here see what it comes up with right see if we can do it okay look at that okay it appears that you might be almost there you can now pick the cards up you can drag them but they don't stick in the new column so I don't know if there's an issue there but well done for getting over the dragon dropping you can see the text that comes in is perfectly punctuated if you see the information I've got whisper flow does a great job here of actually comma putting the commas in the right places and punctuating so it's not just writing the information you would get which you may get from alternative speech to text tools they also have an option as well where you can go through the history and you also can copy and paste anything from your history or from your clipboard as well so if you want to go back to anything you've done previously or tell some or write something you've already written again or just alter it slightly it's also got a dictionary option as well where you can add words to it so if it starts respelling or spelling the words wrong several times I found the dictionary function does help get the spellings correct on things as well that thanks to the beauty of the English language we know that there are several words that are spelled differently but pronounced the same all right okay let's see what we get here I'll probably leave it here even if it doesn't work hey it has worked that's brilliant seems to be a bit of a delay there okay so it does work seems a bit slow maybe it doesn't quite know the positioning just yet interesting it's it's done a reasonable job there we've got the issues slight bugs and things that probably still need fixing we can guess us over these those there by moving things around and I believe we can probably okay this yeah it's still a little bit buggy I wouldn't expect it to be absolutely perfect for 26 minutes worth of work otherwise that would be quite incredible at the moment but however however we have got something it works around 80% of the way we would want it to but we can make some tweaks on here you've got the code there and I think it's done a good job I'm going to stop the video here as my main objective of this was to show how far I could get with whisper flow and without having to type a single word"

        "srt": "So, I recently discovered an AI powered voice typing app that has tripled my productivity. Watch how I write this email. Hi, Christina. The quarterly earnings report is attached. There are three things that I want to bring to your attention. First, the revenue for the West region was up 10% and the revenue for the East region was down 8%. Second, booked calls were up 12% overall. And third, the Q3 the Q3 website traffic, oops, the Q2 website traffic was up 7% overall. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks and have a great weekend. Now, the first thing you'll notice here is that the app formatted everything for me. I didn't have to say paragraphs, bullet points, periods, or anything like that. Everything is nicely formatted for me. You'll also notice that I've messed up my speaking there on bullet point number three, and you won't see any of those mess ups in the actual output. So, the a the AI powered app is doing all of this work for me. So, the app is called Whisper Flow, and I'll put a link in the description to their website. As it says here, it's four times faster than typing, and it's available on both uh Windows, Mac, and the iPhone right now. And I love this graphic they have down here because it really shows the difference between how fast it is to type on a keyboard versus how fast it is to type when you're speaking. And the fact that it reformats all of your text for you and does all that cleanup work makes it even better. So, in this video, I'm going to explain how to use it and also share some tips that I've learned to help save you even more time. So, we'll first take a look at the desktop app. I'm on Windows, but it's also available on Mac. Once you download it and install it, you'll see this app here. As you can see at the top, I've been using it for 7 weeks. I've transcribed almost 40,000 words and I have 120 words per minute output. This is actually low. My output's actually quite a bit more than that. But I do pause a lot and think when I'm speaking into this. So, I think that slows down the words per minute. And down below here, you can see that all you have to do is hold down control and Windows and start speaking into any text box for it to work. It also has your recent activity down here in these transcripts that you can look through your recent activity and copy and paste those if you need them. They're all there. So, let's jump over to Chat GBT and I'll walk through another example of how to use it. It's really easy to use. All I need to do is press and hold that keyboard shortcut control windows when I'm talking. And then when I'm done talking, I just release the shortcut. And when I press the shortcut, you'll see a little black pill appear down here that lets me know it's recording. So, I'll go ahead and do that. I'd like to get your help drafting an email to my boss to request vacation time from September 2nd to the 7th. It's right after month in close and before the holiday rush. So, I think it'd be a good time to take vacation. And so, it takes just a second or two there. And then again, nicely formatted text. We don't have to say periods or anything like that. Just formats that. We'll go ahead and hit enter and let ChatGBT work on that. After recording this, I noticed that it got this phrase here wrong. However, I listened back to the audio and I did pronounce it like this, but it's a good reminder to speak clearly and pronounce all of your words. If I try again down here, it's right after month end close and before the holiday rush. As you can see, it got it right this time because I had better pronunciation. Now, one annoyance here, one thing that can be annoying, but I've learned a way around this is if you're talking I'll go ahead and talk again. Actually, those dates were September 3rd through the 9th. can you reddraft the email? Now, as I was talking there, I accidentally clicked off the text box. So, the focus was lost on the text box and you don't see the transcript or the text appear here in the box. So, this can be annoying if you're working or scrolling around a website or something like that as you're talking and you uh forget or move your focus off the text box. However, you can go into the Whisper Flow app and you'll see your last transcript right here. And you can just click the copy transcript button and then go paste that back into whichever app you're in. And this works on any desktop app or website app. Really, anywhere you can type text, you can use Whisper Flow. And there is a keyboard shortcut for this as well, which is really nice. So, if you go into settings here and go into set default keyboard shortcuts, first of all, you can change the control windows shortcut to enable pushto talk if you want to use a different shortcut. I found that this shortcut works great. It's very easy and I haven't found any conflicts with any other apps or anything like that. So, I really like control windows. And if you scroll down here, there's also a shortcut to paste the last transcript. It's altshift Z by default, but if that one's tough to remember and this is something you use often, you can of course change that right here. Now, at the beginning of the video, I said that Whisper Flow has tripled my productivity. And the way I factor that is just by testing it. This email here has about 70 words, and I typed it out and timed myself. I type at about 60 words per minute, give or take, and also depends on the time of the day and how much coffee I've had. With Whisper Flow, same thing. I can speak at about 150 to up to 200 words per minute. Again, depending on how much coffee I've had, but that really saves me a ton of time, especially if it's late in the day and I'm just making a lot of typos with my good old fingers here. I can just talk and get things done a lot faster. And another place this time savings can stack up is on your phone. Whisper just released an iPhone app. I don't use it a ton yet, but if I'm writing a long document, or taking notes, or writing an email, it can save me a lot of time because I'm very slow at typing on the phone. Now, if you're working in a cubicle, co-working space, or coffee shop, you might be thinking that you don't want everyone around you to hear what you're typing. Well, I think the reason they named it Whisper Flow is because you can actually just quietly whisper into your microphone and it will perfectly detect everything that you're saying. And there you go. Now, Whisper Flow is a paid app. This is the pricing at the time of this recording. They do have a free plan, but those 2,000 words a week, uh, you'll use those up pretty quickly if you're using it as much as I am. I am on the pro plan, and I'm happy to pay for this because it has increased my productivity drastically as I've shown in this video. Whisper did not sponsor this video. However, I do have a referral link down in the description if you want to use that when you sign up. And I should also mention that Windows has a voice dictation app built in. You can activate it by pressing Windows H on the keyboard. I'll go ahead and do that and show how it works. Hi Christina, the quarterly earnings report is attached. There are three things I want to bring to your attention. First, the revenue for the West region was up 10%. Go ahead and deactivate it. And as you can see here, there's no formatting. I need to take extra steps to apply formatting to this. So, that's why I like Whisper Flow because it's using AI to essentially do all of that formatting for us. Hopefully, in the future, Windows comes up with something to integrate Copilot into their voice dictation app to have this all built into Windows because it's a very handy feature that can really improve our productivity. And I also want to mention that in my experience, Whisper Flow is really good at detecting acronyms and unique words. Like if I was to say all of these results are for the AMIA and APAC regions, you can see it gets those abbreviations right away. But if it doesn't, within the app, there is this dictionary tab where you can go add uh unique words or phrases that you say commonly where it might need to autocorrect those. Now, since this is an AI powered app, all of the processing is done in the cloud, but it is all encrypted and you can read more about that on Whisper Flow's website. And if that doesn't bug you, then I'd highly encourage you to check it out because, as I've said, it's really saved me a lot of time and helped me be more productive. And that's what we're all about here at Excel Campus to help you improve your efficiency, not just with your spreadsheets, but also with your workflows as well.

    "text": "In this video I walk you through how I use AI dictation day to day on Mac and why the “best app” depends more on you than the tool. You’ll see Wispr Flow and Superwhisper side by side for speed, accuracy, and intelligent cleanup, then we push into commands, tone changes, and context awareness. I also show you where Spokenly and Voice Ink fit—especially around local vs cloud models, API keys, and privacy—and why some features matter more than flashy demos. If you care about simple dictation I'll cover Wispr Flow, Willow Voice, Aqua Voice, and Ito AI; if you want control, I'll talk about why Superwhisper, Voice Ink, and Spokenly open up deeper workflows.\n\nFrom there, I'll get specific into the features that matter to me as a power user. I will cover Superwhisper context awareness features and overall app interaction compared to VoiceInk and Spokenly. I also tell you some strengths of VoiceInk and Spokenly over Superwhisper and when it's worth it paying the price difference (for unlimited processing with models like OpenAI, Anthropic). \n\nBottom line: pick the lane that matches your brain. If you want no-fuss dictation, Wispr Flow, Willow Voice, or Aqua Voice, Ito AI get you there fast. If you want to shape the tool to your workflow—with custom prompts, model choice , and advanced context—Superwhisper is still my pick, with Voice Ink and Spokenly as solid options depending on your needs.s.\n\nTry Superwhisper:\nhttps://bit.ly/aft-sw\n\nTry VoiceInk:\nhttps://bit.ly/aft-vi\n\nLearn about Prompting for AI Dictation on Skillshare:\nhttps://skl.sh/4hWrtgV\n\nGET MY \"FLEX\" PROMPT:\nhttps://by.afadingthought.com/flex\n\nOTHER APPS MENTIONED\nWispr Flow: https://wisprflow.ai/\nSpokenly: https://spokenly.app/\nWillow Voice: https://willowvoice.com/\nAqua Voice: https://aquavoice.com/\nIto AI: https://ito.ai/\nAlter: https://alterhq.com/ (Get 10% off with code \"AFT\")\nMacrowhisper (automation for Superwhisper): https://github.com/ognistik/macrowhisper\n\nRELATED YOUTUBE VIDEOS\nContext awareness in Superwhisper:    • Pro AI Dictation Tips for Superwhisper: Ma...  \nAlter overview:    • Could Alter Be the Best Mac AI Assistant? ...  \nMacrowhisper:    • Macrowhisper: Voice Automation for Superwh...  \n\nPrompting Tips for Superwhisper:\nhttps://superwhisper.com/docs/modes/c...\n\nStay up to date with what I'm up to:\nhttps://afadingthought.substack.com/\n\nSUPPORT\nIf this content was helpful to you, I hope you can consider buying me a coffee: \nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/afadingthought\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Intro and Goals  \n01:18 Wispr Flow vs Superwhisper Demo\n04:55 What's happening\n06:23 Introducing Spokenly\n07:38 Beyond transcription: real differentiators\n08:10 The Focus on Simplicity\n10:14 The Focus on Power\n12:11 Wispr Flow, Willow Voice, Aqua Voice, Ito AI\n14:47 Intro to Superwhisper\n15:36 Context Awareness Features\n20:25 System Prompts\n24:33 The \"Flex\" Prompt\n25:40 Mode Switching UX\n31:28 AI Models\n32:52 Pricing and Value\n35:44 What's right for you?\n39:26 Superwhisper's not-so-good\n\nDisclaimer: Just a friendly reminder that some links in this video or description may be affiliate ones, earning me a small commission if you purchase through them, at no extra cost to you (and you might even snag some perks!).

        "srt": "Hey guys, my name is Robert. A bit over a year ago, I made a video giving an overview of some of the most popular options available for AI dictation on Mac. At that time, this was a fairly new subject, just gaining popularity, but now, one year later, it has absolutely exploded and it can get very confusing navigating everything we now have available, especially because everyone claims their app is the absolute best. I want to share my thoughts on the current state of this topic and take a look at some popular and not so popular options. I do not believe there is a single app which is the best of all. In my opinion, there is a certain standard that needs to be reached for a dictation app to be considered solid, but above that standard, everything else is a matter of little details in the workflow or implementation of features. One point that many seem to miss is that this is about the user most of all, how you like to work, how you like to get things done, and what do you need. So with this video, I want to help you figure out what kind of user you are. I will also share what features matter to me personally, and based on that, I will try to help you find which tool can actually make your life easier. Just to set the stage, I want to quickly take a look at two very popular but very different options. Whisper Flow, which is known for its extreme user-friendliness, and then there's Super Whisper, which leans into being more powerful and giving you a lot of control. If you take a look at this on the screen right now, you can see that I'm dictating the same thing in both apps simultaneously. I will switch to the larger window of Super Whisper so you can see this better. The moment that I stop my dictation, I've set this up so that the result from Whisper Flow goes to my note and the result from Super Whisper will stay on my recording window. I am not doing any cuts here. I want you to see everything in real time so you get a feel for what's happening in terms of speed. Both can be super fast. Both are also very good in terms of accuracy. But let's try to push this in a different direction. Let me dictate with lots of filler phrases and mistakes. Actually, when I'm dictating, many times I do not know that, no, many times I'm not exactly sure what I will be saying, or so I make many mistakes, and sometimes I stop to think, or I decide to change my words, but in the end, what really matters is to have a good result. Make that bold. Happy face emoji. I dictated this with many mistakes on purpose. This is something more realistic. Both apps not only transcribed, but used AI to understand my message and clean it up. Both took slightly different approaches, but overall, I'm okay with them. I also inserted a formatting command in the middle that Super Whisper executed better. And the emoji, well, it didn't work on Flow. Let's test our detection of formats. Hi, Lucy. Thank you so much for sending the project. I will check with the team, and I will let you know what everyone thinks. How about we have a meeting? No, how about we meet again next week to discuss the following steps and maybe drink a cup of coffee. Put that in parenthesis. I'm available on Monday at 3 p.m. if that works for you. Actually, on Tuesday at 5 p.m. Thanks. Robert. Change Lucy to Jessica. Okay. Both applications detected the pattern, the reading, the message, and the closing. They both corrected my mistakes, like the day and the time. They both tried to follow my command on the change on the name and the parenthesis. Well, flow again didn't do very well there. But how about asking more editing? Let's command a change of tone on something that I dictate. I want you to notice that I am using the exact same setup for all of these tests that I'm performing. I am not changing anything at all. Dictation is amazing for productivity, but as creative, I still think that typing has its place. Make this sound more informal. As you can see, Whisper Flow starts to fall behind when it comes to follow commands mid dictation. Specifically, when it comes to text generation or more complex editing. I could use this example to tell you that Super Whisper is better, but actually that's not the case here, it's just that they are both being prompted differently. If you are just getting started with this, what happens behind the scenes look like this. Both apps go through a transcription process first, where your voice is transformed to text, and then this transcription is passed through a layer of AI processing. The AI processing is the one that defines if commands from the user should be detected and followed, and how they should be followed. Whisper Flow actually does have a command mode that allows for more text generation, and I am sure that it would have given a similar result as what I got from Super Whisper, but that's not my point here. What I just wanted to show you is that in terms of speed and accuracy, they can both perform roughly about the same. When it comes to results, they both can do an excellent job for intelligent cleanup of dictation. Flow's dictation mode is not designed to handle some commands. I threw at it, that's totally fine, but the crazy thing here is that all of this that I have just shown you, which for many users is a test to say that one app is better than the other, has very little to do with the true differentiation aspects between these apps. To show you this, I can do the same kind of a test with awkward dictation in another tool. No, in another application called Spokenly. And that's what you are seeing. No, that's what you are now seeing here in the bottom. One, in terms of accuracy, it's great. Two, in terms of speed, it can also be fantastic. Three, in terms of following commands, it can do the same. I must clarify, there are some minor differences when it comes to speed, a matter of milliseconds actually, but all of this at zero cost. Make zero cost bold and in caps. Now, Whisper Flow costs $12 a month, Super Whisper costs $8.25 a month, and it offers a lifetime option for $250. But how is it that Spokenly can be used for free when it can perform about the same in all the dictation tasks that I showed you? And just to clarify, yes, there's also paid options in Spokenly, but in this case, I was using open source models, which you don't have to pay for at all. Zero. Nada. What I'm trying to say here is that AI dictation is now much more about what happens beyond just getting your words on the screen in a cleanly formatted way. So that aspect that everyone is trying to sell you, saying that their app is faster than typing and accurate and that it understands what you're trying to say or that it is amazing for productivity, all of that is just part of the expected standard right now. Knowing this, let's talk about what makes an app the right fit or not for you. I want to tell you about the two main approaches this app takes because that's the first thing that sets them apart. I want to explain this with two of the apps I just showed you. First, we got Whisperflow. This app is built for simplicity. The whole idea is making AI dictation so easy that anyone can use it to replace typing. You get some customization options, keyboard shortcuts, dictionary words, replacements, but this app is minimal on purpose. It just has the absolute essentials when it comes to settings. They are aiming for the widest market possible, so everything stays pretty straightforward. At the same time, everything is a bit of a mystery. It truly feels magical if you jump to this for the first time without having checked out any of the other alternatives, because you don't know what's going on. I do have to say something important here. A bit over a year ago, when Whisperflow was pretty new, there were a lot of questions and complaints about privacy regarding this app. What kind of data was being captured? How was it being used? At that time, the team was not clear about this as well, and their privacy policy was a confusing mess. Recently, however, I have noticed they have been proactively improving in this area. And look, none of the existing apps is perfect. What matters to me is that right now, at least, it seems like the team at Whisperflow is listening. They are trying to communicate more, and I can see the improvements. The app now has more settings that allow opt-out for data retention or training, and you can also turn off context awareness if you prefer. They have also obtained certifications that ensure privacy for health professionals or corporations. All of this to say that, even though I still find a lot of their marketing strategy too spammy, pushy, and I do not agree that AI dictation will or should replace old typing, I think that as a product that aims for the most user-friendliness, it's very solid. On the other side of the spectrum, you have Super Whisper. This app is a big contrast. It's built for control, transparency, and power. Instead of hiding things, it actually shows you everything that is being captured and sent. It lets you run with local models or cloud models, which allow for a higher degree of privacy if you care about that. You can toggle on and off a lot of options that will personalize your interactions with the app and the results that you get, which means you also have an incredible amount of flexibility. With custom modes where you are in full control of the instructions sent to AI and with unlimited usage of AI included for the latest OpenAI or cloud models, Super Whisper can be used for more than simple dictation. It can truly be a powerful AI assistant that you can deeply integrate into more advanced workflows. In short, this app puts the user in control, letting you customize things to an impressive degree. That's the fundamental difference. I must say that I still think simplicity is a characteristic of good app design. I am not against this. It's just that apps that follow the line of Whisperflow put user-friendliness at the very core of everything and sacrifice some customization to achieve it. Apps that follow the line of Super Whisper start from a different place. They build for power and flexibility first, then they try to make that complexity manageable. Both approaches are valid, it just depends on what you value more. Having things work without any tweaking right out of the box, or having the freedom to shape the tool around your own particular workflow. So when you are looking at all of these AI dictation tools I will mention, the first thing is to figure out what kind of user you actually are. This is more important than you may think, and it can save you lots of time and frustrations down the road. So what do we have in the first group? Whisper Flow is the most popular in this category, but there are other good alternatives. Willow Voice keeps the same minimal approach, and what sets it apart is that it learns from your corrections. It captures edits that you do on the results and uses this to adapt to your style. Aqua Voice takes things a step further with an optional mode where you can see the text streaming in real time as you dictate. I really like that the default dictation of Aqua Voice allows for the kind of formatting commands as I was showing you in the beginning of the video. And all of that can optionally show up right in this floating panel if you have it active. It's actually pretty cool, put that in parenthesis. It's just a bit slower when used like this. It also uses Avalon, their own transcription model that claims to be more accurate with technical terms. AquaVoice also lets you enter custom instructions that apply based on which app you are using. It feels like this app is stepping a little bit into advanced territory because of the features it has. On the other hand, Aqua does not currently have a command mode that you can find in both Whisperflow and WillowVoice. This is what allows you to do stuff like, hey, write me an outline for one article on AI dictation. Now, an important thing to consider is that Whisperflow, AquaVoice, and WillowVoice, they are all subscription-based, and it makes sense because they use cloud models for transcription and processing. This is what allows them to perform with the speed and accuracy they need. Actually, a lot of what they do behind the scenes, like I was saying before, it's still quite a bit of a mystery, so there's not a lot of information out there about how processing happens, what specifically is being captured, and how. This means that when it comes to privacy or handling of data, you basically just have to trust them. Because of that, I was happy to find an open-source alternative that takes a similar approach but with way more transparency. It's called E2AI. Right now, the app is in a very early stage. It only does basic clean-up and has a command mode, but it's getting better fast and it should catch up to the others soon. The main thing here is that, since E2AI is open-source, you can see exactly what's happening under the hood. Currently, it's free and there's instructions available so you can even build it yourself. Now, let's switch to the other group. I have been using Super Whisper for over a year and I should probably admit upfront that I am a bit biased here. My whole setup already depends on it so it's tough for me to be completely neutral. It's not perfect though. I actually have specific frustrations and that's what has made me look around at other options. I'll get into those later. But for now, I want to focus on what matters to me as someone who needs more control and customization. For users new to this, maybe apps like Spokenly or Voicing that I will cover in this section could be enough, but I'm looking at this from a different angle. I am testing this against what I already know that worked for me, so I am using SuperWhisper as a standard here. First, let's talk about context awareness. This for me is one of the most important advanced features. It's about the app knowing not just what you are saying, but also receiving information about what you are working on and providing that to AI so you can get better results. Whisper is very strong here and it handles context capture in a very sophisticated way. It captures three main types of context: selective text, application context, and clipboard context. The amazing part here is that it captures this at different specific timings. I have a video that explains all of this in detail, but in summary, this allows you to craft pretty complex requests. For example, let's say: Hey, I need you to grab my selected text and give it the same kind of formatting you find in my application context. As you noticed, I started my dictation with a selected text and stopped dictating in another app. Then I got the result I expected. Everything formatted in bullets. After testing with voice ink, I was surprised to find that there is a bit of a difference with timing, but it can actually do the same. Hey, I needed to grab my selected text and give it the same format you find in my application context. With voice ink, I have to end my dictation where I have my selected text, which feels a little bit strange because the result is gone and it's only on my clipboard. It's okay. I just have to paste and the result is about the same. One thing I personally don't like is how voice ink deals with clipboard context. It will always include it, whereas in Super Whisper, I am in control of whether I want to copy something or not during dictation. That's just a minor detail. Something that is more important to me is that application context in Super Whisper is more powerful for many of my use cases, which have to do with grinding and developing content. Both voicing and spokenly will only capture a screenshot of your current app window, but Super Whisper will capture all the content that you have in your active input field. What do I mean by this? Okay, let me show you. Hey, tell me the name of the person in the first sentence. See, it grabbed my name, and above is actually part of the script of the video you are watching now, and there is my name on the first sentence. Super Whisperer can grab all of this, but now let's try the same with voicing. Hey, tell me the name of the person in the first sentence. It fails to give me a good response because it's only seeing what I am seeing. The way Super Whisperer does it is powerful because it lets you do things like summarize a long document you are working on, give you a critique on a piece you are writing. You can be dictating an article and AI will understand everything else you have dictated so far so it can help you make a more cohesive piece of work. When I'm coming up with ideas for the videos like the one you are watching now, many times I dictate a long stream of consciousness and after I get that in my Notes app, I ask: \"Hey, make me a simple outline from what you see in my app context. I need to structure my thoughts better.\" By the way, guess what? At the time of making this video, the only other A dictation app I have tested that currently allows me to do something like this is Whisperflow in Command Mode. And you can say: \"But Robert, you are not using this for dictation anymore.\" And that's a very good point. I'm the kind of person who looks at a tool and tries to think beyond what was this designed to do. Instead, I look at this from a \"what can I make this do\" perspective. I think Superwisper is the top option for me because of all the possibilities it presents when approached like this. In this case, the app is great not only for dictation, but also for AI assistance. This is also the reason why I was a bit heartbroken when I found that spokenly the other app I briefly introduced earlier was part of the Mac App Store. That is because this app, which I also want to tell you a bit more about, has a philosophy that I really connect with. It has so many advanced settings and customization options, perhaps even more than Voicing and Super Whisper. Sadly, by being inside the App Store, it means that it is sandboxed and it doesn't have access to all of these other APIs for accessibility that allow for deeper integration with the system. I know that for some users, downloading an application like this from the App Store will give them a lot of peace of mind, but when it comes to context capture, this is also the reason it's very limited, but it can do one thing very well: it gives the user absolute control over the system prompt. This is another aspect that really matters to me. The system prompt is basically the set of instructions that tells AI how to behave, what to do with your words, how to format them, what rules to follow. It's the behind-the-scenes guide that shapes every result you get. This is probably the biggest reason I lean towards these three apps over the simpler ones. With Whisperflow and similar tools, the main system prompt is locked down. You cannot see it or change it. Yes, some of those apps do allow for a bit of custom instructions, but you are still very limited on what you can do, even with the ones that offer a command or assistant mode. Spokenly, Voicing, and Super Whisper all give you this flexibility in a bit of a different way. Spokenly could potentially give you the most power in this area because while editing the system prompt, you can insert placeholders for the different context types available. This is pretty awesome. Unfortunately, the context limitations I mentioned earlier because of the App Store sandboxing hold it back. In Voicing, when you edit a prompt, you have a toggle that will define if you want your instructions to be attached to the main dictation prompt or if you want total control. I really like this approach. It's very simple and I think that it avoids a lot of confusion that I see from users in Super Whisper. Super Whisper takes a different approach. It offers some presets when you create a mode. You can choose between Messages for basic cleanup, email formatting, meeting summaries. This is meant to make the app more user-friendly for people who don't like to mess with custom instructions. But you can also build custom modes from scratch, which is what I do for the most part. Something that users have to know is that, unlike spokenly or voicing, where you have the ability to use your instructions attached to the original dictation system prompt, here we do not have that yet. Let me show you what that means in action. In spokenly, I go to my custom instructions and add it. Always output the dictation in a very professional tone. Now let me dictate with this, and it shows up with something. The result is transformed as expected, but let's try the same with Super Whisper. I create a custom mode, and I add the exact same instructions. Now I will switch to that mode, and I will dictate, and it shows up with something. What's happening here? The application is working as intended, it's just that the AI model doesn't know that I'm trying to get this text transformed into something else. In spokenly, I would get a similar result if I go into Advanced Settings and change the actual system prompt. This is what trips some users off, because yes, you have an amazing amount of flexibility, and honestly, with the behavior of context captured, like I showed you, plus this flexibility with prompting, I think Super Whisper does give you more power at this point of time than any of the other apps. By setting your custom instructions correctly, you can also imitate some of the behavior of the apps in the first group, as I was showing you in the beginning. But if you don't know how this works, you can also end up very frustrated because you may dictate something that sounds like a request, and the AI will try to answer you, or you will not be getting the results that you expect. I made a short class about this on Skillshare. In case you want to master the basics of prompting Indictation apps, I will give you the link to that in the description. I also wrote a short guide that is up on Super Whisper documentation. In short, all three apps I'm covering in this group handle this differently, but in Super Whisper, you may need to put in a bit more effort. I know there are plans to improve this in the future. By the way, I will be giving you the assistant prompt that I have been showing you so far. It's a work in progress, but what I have been trying to experiment with is creating one flexible prompt that I can use for multiple things. For example, I am sorry, but I cannot make it tomorrow. How about we reschedule, Robert? Make this an email for John. In this case, I dictated my main content, I commanded a specific type of formatting, and I got my result. Now, I can jump in there and add a little bit more without changing anything in my setup. Something came up with my family. So this prompt that I have created is pretty good at recognizing whenever I am commanding something about the format or when I am dictating content. It does it all according to instructions I have set myself. And since we got selected text context in Super Whisper, I can even do this. Make this more casual. Now, for that example I just showed you, I did not switch between different instructions at all, but normally you will want to be switching. This will allow you to set targeted instructions for better, more consistent results. It will allow you to set specific AI models for specific tasks, or you can even customize more options within each mode. That is why I think it's very important that I talk a little bit about the user interaction when switching modes. This is where I found the most friction trying to adapt my workflow to VoiceInc or Spokenly. All three apps let you set automatic rules for auto-switching based on which application you are in. With Spokenly, you need to have more than one AI prompt for this option to appear. In VoiceInc, you set this when you are creating a new power mode, and in Super Whisperer, you also got that under each mode settings. Let's say you want a specific rule for a specific tone formatting when you are dictating in Slack, or you have a different way of communicating in WhatsApp. Maybe you always want dictations formatted as emails in your mail app. You can set up stuff like that. I normally do not use this feature because in the same app that I use for note-taking, I write emails, I write outlines, I summarize stuff, so I prefer switching manually when I have to. I like to be in absolute control. In Spokenly, you can set keyboard shortcuts for each separate AI prompt, but here's the problem that I have with that. Dictation should empower your flow state. By that, I mean that it should be as non-disruptive as possible. If I'm about to start dictating, I don't want to think. What's the shortcut for writing emails? What's the shortcut for outlining an article? So, I do have a personal issue with the way that Spokenly does it. Voicing improves this with the ability to set one keyboard shortcut to always start or stop dictation. Once you start, you switch with modifiers plus numbers. I really like that it's the same one action to start or stop dictating. I also like that if you don't set a default power mode, your choice stays active. This means that whatever mode you used the last time will stay for the next time. But switching with modifiers and numbers feels very awkward to me. You also have a very confusing separation between AI enhancements and power modes. On the other hand, in this app, you have something cool, which is trigger words. This means you can start dictating with a specific word and your text will be automatically processed by the AI prompt you have associated with that, but you run into the same issue as keyboard shortcuts that I was telling you with spokenly, having to decide what word you will have to say the exact same moment you are about to start dictating. This breaks a lot of my concentration and flow. So, we have many different options to set this up, but the overall functionality design could be much better. I think that Super Whisper made a genius decision by setting mode switching as separate from dictation. It's two separate processes. So, if you want, you can start and stop dictating with your custom keyboard shortcut in a similar way as VoidSync. You can also switch between modes after you start dictating. Your last chosen mode will carry over to the next interaction. Same thing. What makes all the difference for me is that you can switch modes before you start dictating. You can do it directly within the interface of Super Whisper, or you can do it via deep links, which allow for a lot of automation possibilities that I will not be getting into in this video. But this means that you can switch modes with Alfred, Raycast, or stuff like Better Touch Tool, Keyboard Maestro, and more. The reason this is very important for me as someone who cares about focus and productivity is that every time my brain decides to start working on something, my fingers already did the change. Not when I'm about to start talking in the microphone, but the moment of making that internal switch, my creative side connects with my hands. It's super intuitive and I haven't found that anywhere else. This also gives me some more advanced flexibility in my workflow because this means that I can dictate one time and test that recording through different modes. This is me and I am dictating without any AI processing and you can see, I mean, you can notice how the raw dictation looks like. When I'm using AI directly in something like ChatGPT or Altar, I use this without any extra processing because it's the fastest. It is messy, but AI has no trouble understanding me. But with Super Whisperer, once I dictate it, I can switch modes with one key press. If I start a new dictation right now, it will be cleaned up, but I can also reprocess what I just dictated. Okay, we've got a cleaned up version, but say that I want to run it through another prompt to translate it into Spanish. I just do the switch, and I run the same audio through it. None of the other applications allow you to do this, and it's all related to the disconnection between the mode switching and dictating actions. It's super handy because sometimes you can run the same dictation against multiple prompts until you get what you need, or this also allows you to quickly transcribe the same thing with different models to check their speed or accuracy. With other apps, you have to open the application, go to the history panel, and choose how you want to reprocess a specific dictation. Having this at your fingertips is an incredible time saver. So when it comes to the main interaction with the app, which is mode switching, for me, Super Whisper wins here. Now, I want to briefly touch on one more aspect that matters to power users, AI models. There's two sides to this, transcription models and LLM processing. When it comes to transcription models, both spokenly and voicing offer way more options than Super Whisper. Let me tell you that technology in this field is moving incredibly fast, and I expect we will eventually reach a point where all models are fast, smart, and accurate across multiple languages. We are getting close, but we are not there yet. Right now, different models are good at different things. Some transcribe better in certain languages, and some prioritize speed over accuracy. Throughout this video, I have been using Super Whisper's S1 voice model for transcription. It's a cloud model based on Whisper that's incredibly fast, almost instant for quick dictation. If you are on voicing or spokenly, you've got a local model called Parakeet, which is also crazy fast, but the accuracy is worse. I would say, for people who are okay with Whisper models and their language support, or who are fine with Nova models, which, by the way, include real-time transcription and speaker separation, then you will be fine with Super Whisper. But the truth is, there's constant competition with new models coming out all the time, and this app does not incorporate them as quickly as voicing or spokenly. This area that has to do with AI models also plays a role with the pricing of each app. Voicing is a one-time payment at $25. It doesn't include cloud models usage in this pricing. You pay for that with your own API keys. After purchase, you could also use it with local models at no cost, of course. Spokenly can be used totally for free in this same way, with local models and with your own API keys. The difference here is that you don't have to pay anything if you go this route. This app will only require a subscription payment if you wanted to manage the access to all the AI being used. That way you don't need to deal with API keys and stuff like that. Finally, SuperWhisper offers both a subscription and a one-time payment option at $250, which sounds like a crazy difference compared to the other two, but here's the thing. SuperWhisper is the only option in AI dictation that provides true unlimited access to the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic for processing your dictation or transcribed audio files. That can be a massive advantage. So I'll say that right now, SuperWhisper is my personal top choice because of the combination of features that I have talked about. There's a lot more I haven't covered, like all the automation possibilities if you get MacroWhisper that I built for this. I got other videos on that topic. Something to consider is that even if Voice Inc. eventually matches SuperWhisper's features for app context and makes the interaction more intuitive, or if spokenly, leaves the app store and becomes more powerful, I really doubt they will ever offer unlimited AI processing at a one-time payment the way SuperWhisper does. For many users who know what unlimited SONE or unlimited CHGPT means, this starts to sound too good to be true. And it is. But here's another important thing. Most people don't actually need these premium models in a dictation app. Throughout this video for LLM processing, I have been using a model called Kimi K2 through Grok, which is totally free because it's open source. For quick dictation tasks, I don't generally go for open AI or anthropic models at all because, yes, they are smarter, but slower. The unlimited AI processing becomes most useful when you combine it with SuperWhisper's other features and start to use it as an assistant or for more complex tasks. It's also great if you are processing longer dictations and don't mind sacrificing some speed for better results. Finding this app has been quite life-changing for my learning of AI and it has revolutionized how I use my computer, but if you are just planning to do quick dictations and format emails or bullet lists, maybe, just maybe you'll be fine with something else. As I start to grab up this video, I want to give you a quick summary or rather a guide to help you figure out what right for you. If you are still watching this far, but feel like all you need is simplicity and user friendliness above anything else, then go with apps in that first group. Go with AquaVoice if you need some customization with instructions. WillowVoice may be a great alternative if you want some of that personalization in terms of writing style, but you want it to happen automatically. I would say WhisperFlow also is a very solid choice, especially now that they have fixed a lot of the communication or privacy issues that I saw in the past. I also really like the context awareness that's available for command mode in WhisperFlow. You can do powerful stuff with that. Any of these apps will work well if you want something super straightforward and don't mind the subscription tag. There's also the open source Ito AI that I mentioned. It might be enough for you. At this point, it's very basic, but it's free and it will give you fast dictation with a general cleanup. The main limitation here is that it doesn't have as many extra tricks compared to the other apps yet, but I think you will get there soon. Another option for users that are okay with something simple is Alter. This app is primarily a very powerful AI assistant and you can get access to its voice features for $29 a year. I would say that the dictation itself is more basic than anything I have mentioned so far, but if you are interested in the assistant capabilities or need transcription with speaker separation, then the dictation becomes a nice little extra. I have covered more about Alter in a few other videos if you want to learn more about it. If you want to put in a little bit more effort and level up from the basic options, I think Spokenly would be a good entry-level app for this category. If you want to use your own API keys and local models, you can use it for free. If you pay for it, you don't have to deal with any of that. This app actually does have some more advanced features that I didn't mention in this video, like the triggering of scripts, which allows for some automation and you can set more parameters for the LLMs. It's just that for me, it always hits those sandboxing limits. If this app eventually implements AppContext correctly or comes up with a version outside of the App Store, it could truly expand its capabilities and jump to the next level. But I'm not sure if we will ever see that happen. For now, though, I think it's the best middle ground. For power users who love to customize, Voice Ink is solid, but it's not my personal top pick right now. The workflow choices with the interface feel awkward, the separation between enhancements and power modes is confusing, and design-wise, it just doesn't feel well thought out. There are too many small friction points that add up, things that make you pause or second-guess yourself when you should be focused on your work. At this point, I would find it very difficult to switch. If you haven't used Super Whisper, maybe it's good enough for you, especially if you don't need the unlimited AI models that Super Whisper offers. Super Whisper continues to be my recommendation for users who care about personalizing their workflow. The unlimited AI side definitely sets it apart, but it's all the other details in the implementation of features that actually allow you to take advantage of that power, and it can expand into so many different areas. If you care about productivity, automation around your system by voice, you are into deep work, or if you are interested in exploring the possibilities of AI across anything that has to do with voice or text, I still think that there's nothing that has reached this level yet. Let me be real with you about something. Part of the reason I have been testing all these other apps is because Super Whisper went through some changes that really frustrated me. The settings panel got redesigned a few months back and it made everything harder to navigate. Some things that I have always considered little secret features have ended up being non-intentional and removed. Plus, now there are these notifications that show up every time you switch modes. I hate them so much and find them really distracting when I'm trying to focus. See, I don't mind changes, but I think that they should not affect the overall workflow that people are already used to. If changes will be implemented, then there should be the option to preserve the previous behavior and stuff like this. Sometimes I get the impression that this app is caught between being a power tool and trying to compete with simpler options like Whisperflow. I don't think that should happen. They are very different markets. What's unfortunate is that because of this identity crisis, it seems like Super Whisper sometimes struggles with giving users more settings and control. That's a shame because power and flexibility are its biggest strengths. Super Whisper is also a small team working on Windows and iOS versions at the same time. So the focus and communication with users could be much better. That said, I have seen several improvements lately. There's been fixes to the interface. The app feels more stable. I have talked with Neil, the developer, a few times, and I feel like he is listening more. The last few months have definitely been bumpy, but I still believe where this is headed. After spending time looking at other alternatives and seeing how they do things, I can definitely see how Super Whisperer is not the best option for everyone, and I hope that everything I have shared here can help you figure this out for yourself. As for me, I'm happy with this app and hope to continue making more content about how I use it in the future. I just really need those stupid notifications gone. Please. Thank you so much for watching guys. If this video was useful to you and you decide to try Super Whisper, I hope you all consider using my affiliate link.

        "srt": "so you might or might not have heard of a new trend called Vibe coding this is a term that was Co by Andre karpathy who is one of the founding members of open AI he also worked on self-driving at Tesla this really started the Cascade of this trend of vibe coding this video I'm going to be showing you whisper flow and what whisper flow allows you to do is not just use this within your IDE you can use this across your computer basically any apps within chat gbt and GitHub cursor whatever it might be you can use it to respond to emails first before I dive into the vibe coding once you've installed it it's very simple just go through the prompts so all they have to do is tap the whisper flow hotkey to get started and you can set it to whatever works best for you I can say I want to build out a full stack nextjs application let's get started with a few different features that I can use to build out an AI application whisper flow you pretty much get a response instantaneously I have an idea for our Vibe coding project and what I want to do is I want to have an interface where a user can put in a query it will search the internet for the results and then will display those results as well as the contents and the top key pieces on each of the pages but what I'm going to be using throughout the video is whisper flow as well as cursor within here this is what cursor looks like if you haven't used it I have on the right hand side this panel for my composer as well as chat and then I have a brand new directory with a terminal open here so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to hop over to composer and I'm going to go over to agent mode so with agent mode what it can do is it can read and write files but it can also execute commands within your terminal what I'm going to do here is I'm going to MPX create next app I'm going to create it within the root of our directory I'm just going to go ahead and accept everything here now we have the basis of our application that we want to build when this I'm going to demonstrate I'm not typing here I'm just going to be speaking this into my microphone and it will go and transcribe this and to say I want something that's similar to chat GPT where there's just a search bar at the center of the screen I want to use a really nice subtle animation from motion let's go ahead and send this in and we see okay I want to create a chat GPT like interface with a centered search bar with subtle animations it installed the motion Library it read the page. TSX file now it wants to create this components folder within the root of our directory and we see it's just going through and now it's creating this search bar component within the components folder it's generating the code for that we can see it now within here and it's just going through the process of all of the different pieces that we asked now let's update the main page to use our search bar component we can see that this is pretty much going faster than I can even describe it within the video now if I go and I accept this and I mpm run Dev once I open this up I should hopefully see what we asked for one thing to point out with this is you're going to be able to talk way faster than you will be able to type using whisper flow we have this nice little animation when I click on that interface there I'm going to go step by step adding in piece by piece the different pieces that I want within my application so I'm going to say now once I submit a query I want to have some lurm itum data that leverages the react flow Library where I can have a visualization with a number of different nodes that I can drag around and interact with I'll go ahead and I'll install react flow as well as the types here now the other cool thing with cursor and the composer agent is if it executes a command that it doesn't know will have the context of the terminal within the agent and will also even have the linter if it notices that it couldn't install a particular thing or maybe it got something wrong or there are some types it needs to install it will do all of that with a pretty high level of reliability and this is really increasing as these llms improve in their capabilities here we see a number of different changes and just like karpathy said I'm going to go ahead and accept this I'm not even going to read through the changes I'm going to hop back to our application and if I just say hello world I'll send that in and there we go we have this basic implementation we have our alarm if some data of react flow and we also have the query what I'm going to do now is I'm going to open up our composer again and I'm going to grab the documentation for the search endpoint and what I'm going to say is if I go docs what you can do within here is you can add in a new Doc and this can be any web page I'll just paste this in and I'll call this fir Coss search API we have the entry point of what is going to scrape and then index once you click confirm you'll be able to reference this at any point in any future project that you use with cursor all that we have the documentation context within composer I'm going to be speaking using whisper flow I'm not typing again I want to use the fir crawl search API for when a user submits a query that it uses that query for the search results and once these search results are returned that will show in a visualization within our flow diagram here again we get all of that back that probably would have taken me four or five times as long as it did to just transcribe that and to speak that it's kicking off the process it's updating some of the files so here we go this is a demonstration of when there are linter errors it will just feed that context back into the agent and resolve those now I'm going to create ourv file and I'm just going to copy this put it in here and I'm going to grab an API key from fir craw once we have that we can go and look at our application again I can say hello world I'll send that in we see that it failed to fetch let's just open up the console here and see what the error is if we go over to network and if we try this again we can see that it is making a request on the front end directly to the fir craw API now that we have an idea what the bug is going to say the request is being made from the front end of the application I'm going to have to set up an API route within the nextjs project here I want to use app router to set that up so when a user sends in the query into that input box it first goes through our own API and then that API makes a request to the fir craw endpoint here we see it's going to set up our API route using nextjs it created this API folder with the route of search we can take a look at what it's doing here it's using the fir Coss search API it's making the request it's limiting to five and the format is marked down now if we send it in I see Hello World we have these different pages here we have our graph we have our initial query and we have what looks to be like a number of sites now if I put in a query like blog posts from open Ai and I send that through we see that we have this nice little spinner and then hopefully we get the results we have these different links here but let's make it a little bit more interactive now I want to have when the query is sent in I want the query to be reflected within the middle of the flowchart and then I want to have all of the nodes connecting from that Central node of all of the different top results that it searched for here it went ahead and made some more changes again I'm just going to command enter accept everything I'm going to hop back to our application and without even refreshing it we have exactly what we asked for here we have the blog post from openai which was our query and then we have all of these different notes now that this is working better than expected I'm just going to go right into the vibe and let's see what we can do so I'm gonna say I want a header I want a footer I want a linear gradient background that maybe changes and animates a little bit like I want the overall site to be Black theme but also have these hints of neon purple and blue but I want it to be very subtle in terms of any animations and that type of stuff we'll let it go through and run its course let's run through those updates let's accept these and let's take a look look now we have this we have our header we have our footer there will be some things that'll also tweak within this now we have this different visualization there are some things I also don't like this underline when this is selected so what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to take a screenshot and I'm going to go over to cursor and I'm just going to describe what I don't like about it I don't that white background that should actually be black and for the react flow diagram there I want that to be black and for the input on hover or select that Focus state I don't like the underline I'd rather have the focus effect be around that entire input and not just below it we have that transcription we're going to send that through let's accept those changes it didn't quite get this white background here so upon inspecting I can see on this main element that we have these classes that are causing the conflict so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say I notice there's still a white box that's centering all of the main contents on the page here are the classes just make sure that you remove anything that's white or any border or anything that could affect with the overall design that and then from there I'll also just paste in those classes so it has the context of what to search for and here we see I'll help you find and remove that white background that class might be in your main component it's finding that main component it looks like it found that adjustment that we asked for now if I hop back to our application we're looking pretty good so how can I help you today I can just say I want to find out in Tropics latest blog post I'll send that through we have our loading State and there we go it nicely animated all of the different links within this and you could begin to build on this another cool thing with this is let's say I want to edit a piece of text this could be an email an article a Blog whatever it might be it can be in whatever application you're using in this case I'm using Google Docs and what I can say is hey Flo instead of a paragraph I want this to be a sentence and in this case what it did is it took that piece of selected text and it sent it to a large language model for us and it returned the result with the instructions the other cool thing that I can do within this is I can say search Chat GPT for how far away the Moon is and what it will do is it will take that query and it will also open up the chat GPT application with that query ready to send and this will work with CLA perplexity and a ton of other Integrations I really encourage you to try out Vibe coding it's really easy to get set up with a whisper flow you just go through the onboarding steps and then you can try out all of the features like I demonstrated"

        "srt": "I've used many methods to capture all of my content into Obsidian, but the method I'm going to show you in this video might be the most easy and low friction of all of the ones I've discovered so far. You're going to learn about a new app that I've started using and how it fits into capturing information on mobile as well as on desktop. You'll see the setups I have as well as the Obsidian plugins that are needed to make the note capturing possible. and I'll run you through all of the different configurations so you can start using exactly the same method that I do. So, we'll start with how it works on a laptop and I'll take you onto my MacBook to show you exactly how I do this when I'm sat at my desk. Okay, so here we are in Obsidian. Firstly, I'll quickly run you through my folder structure just so you know what we're working with and how I capture information. So um I use a modified version of the power method um from Thiago Forte uh where we keep projects the same where it's basically just where you keep folders of notes that are geared towards certain outcomes. So you can see I want to release a new PKM4 students course which you'll get information about if you click the top link in the description and sign up but I might touch on that a little bit more later in the video. Um, so you can see all of the notes that I'm taking specifically related to this outcome in this project. So that's where the notes go in the projects folder. Areas in my own system called parazettle is a zetle custom. So it's atomic notes of one idea per note which are interlin in the obsidian graph and in resources that's kind of the more useful content for longterm where I might need to reference it again. A lot of it is other people's writing where especially in my in my rewise folder where I've got all of the articles and read wise highlights and notes are things that I've captured. And the archive is where all of these old folders go to um not clutter up the rest of the vault. And the most important folder of all that we're going to get into where I capture all of my content into is the inbox folder. So you can see here it's simply just a place where it's it's a dumping ground basically for the notes that I take. And so that's the folder structure and we'll get into exactly how I capture the content. But first I wanted to introduce to you the app that I use to do all of this. So it's called Whisper Flow and it's a transcription app. And in the past, I've tried using a lot of these different transcription apps from Apple's own proprietary kind of transcription into text boxes where you can hold down the function key or the globe key and it will transcribe for you into a text box. But none of these methods that I'd used before Whisper Flow were actually good enough for me to use consistently. But Whisper Flow is, and I'm going to demonstrate it to you. In this video, I'm going to show you how I add it into my vault so I can show you how I capture all of my thoughts quickly and easily with really, really low friction because, as you'll see, it operates from speech now as opposed to even just typing out the notes. Back here into the vault, we're going to require one additional plugin in Obsidian for at least for desktop usage. When I show you mobile usage, it's a little bit different, but we are going to require the quick ad plugin, which is a popular plugin that allows you to add certain templated content into your fault. And it's what I'll use to create these inbox notes and give it all of its certain attributes. So, it's it's very simple in comparison to all of the other templates that I kind of use in my vault. So, we'll I'll take you into a community plug-in, Quick Ad, which you might need to install if you don't have it installed, but you just do that by going to community plugins and clicking browse and then type in quick add in, and it comes up. So, you can see I've already got it installed. But we'll go to the settings and the quick configuration that is of interest in this video is quick just there. So, new quick note. So the configuration for this is to simply capture to that inbox folder where all of the information goes every single time I capture it because of course you can go through that inbox and filter it and put it in different folders in your vault later if you need to. But all I do to title those files is give them a date stamp. So I use this just here. You can see it's going to save a note in five hyphen inbox which is the inbox folder. And the note is going to be called the year, the month, the day, the hour, minute, second, just because I take quite a few of these notes and I don't want them to be called the same thing and run into um conflicts that way. And I don't need to even use a template to create this note because as you'll see in a moment, the note is blank because I don't want to try and configure too much before I actually process the note and move it into a suitable folder in my vault. So, it's literally just a blank note like that. We select that we want the note to open when we create it. And we select focus new pane and capture format. You can see the capture format is empty, which means that no content is going to be captured the second we open the note. Um, so it's a very simple configuration like that because like I said, we don't want to make it too complicated at the moment. And one thing I have done as well for this quick ad configuration is I've assigned it a hotkey because I capture new content all the time. And so you'll do this by first of all, you want to make sure you have that little kind of lightning bolt icon switched on because if you switch it off, you won't be able to access it in the command pallet. or maybe not even in the hot keys, I don't think. So, you want that to be switched on. And then you go to hotkeys and you search quick and you find your certain configuration. There's mine, new quick. And you can see that I've bound it to um well, it's command shift Q for most people, but I rebind my keys, so don't worry about that. Just pick something that you can access very quickly and easily so that you've not got any pressure on you to make a new note in a certain way or not. Um, and then I'll show you what this looks like in my vault. Say, okay, I want to capture some new information. I've got some new information and I will just press that keyboard shortcut and I'm opened up into a brand new inbox note ready to capture. And this is where Whisper Flow comes in. And so when you install Whisper Flow, you go through uh their setup process. I mean, they guide you through that very nicely, so I'm not going to show you that. But once you've got that set up, all you have to do is hold down the key that you've assigned to be your transcription key. Uh, so I would do the function or globe key and hold it down and I speak. And you can see at the bottom of the screen that it's recording what I say now. You can see this little flow bar um, just there. And once I release that, it's transcribed everything I've said with perfect accuracy into that inbox note. And so this just blows typing your words out of the water because say you've got something really complicated or you've got little time to take a note or something you've got. Uh so I'll show you an example or okay today I managed to make some progress on the project about making a new course for students and I just wanted to quickly capture all the information to do with this. So I updated the minimal note takingaking folder, the note that talks about Zotterero and how to manage references and things like that. And the progress is good so far. So I hope I can keep going. And if we leave that and you can see that the the transcription is almost immaculate like it's picked up so which is um software that I use for referencing or used for referencing whilst I was in university. But it's fantastic in this way in just being able to really quickly capture content and then all I have to do is access those notes from my inbox and then I can go through and process them at my leisure. But that's exactly the configuration that I use for desktop. It's just a simple keyboard shortcut and quicker configuration and then you use whisper flow to enter content into your notes. And so now I'll show you through my mobile setup, which is a little bit more complicated to integrate with iOS shortcuts and things like that, but it's definitely still worthwhile setting up because being able to take notes on the move is really, really useful as well, especially hands-free. So being able to speak the note. First, we'll go over the quick configuration in my mobile Obsidian Vault. Excuse me. And this is exactly the same as on desktop. So I'll show you that quickly. You can see the same vault. I use Obsidian Sync, but there are different methods of syncing your notes between desktop and mobile. So I'll take you to quick ad and show that I have I call it something slightly different here, QuickNote. But if you look through it's exactly the same in that there's no template because I don't need one. the file is opened and the new pane's focused and there's no capture format. And the thing is on mobile now what you need is a app that is going to configure a URI which is simply a link that you can open and cause to execute a specific action in said app. So I will show you what this looks like for mobile Obsidian. What you'll need is advanced URI. So again, we install by going to community plugins and browse and then advanced URI. And you can see I've got it installed already. And so once you've got that installed, you head into advanced URI. You don't need you don't even need to do that actually. You need to go to your command pallet and then select advanced URI copy URI for command because that will allow you to generate a link that when run will take you to your Obsidian Vault and help you execute what we're about to see here. So you click copy URI for a command. you don't specify the file and then because you've kept your little lightning icon on on your quick ad then you can search quick ad and then new quicknote and so you can see at the bottom there it said advanced URI copy to clipboard and now what you'll need from here I'm sorry this is a um iOS iOS workflow um but what you'll need to do here then is to go to your shortcuts app and you can see I've already got a take a quick note configuration setup, which if I demonstrate to you, this is what is going to happen once we've set up what we need to set up. If I demonstrate that to you now, you can see it takes me straight to Obsidian with a inbox file that we can straight away capture information into. But what I'm going to do first is show you how I set that up. So, I'm going to completely delete that shortcut just as a form of demonstration. and we're going to click top right to make a new shortcut. And then what we need to do is search the action open URLs and you add that in there. And then you paste your advanced URI that you've just found from Obsidian and click done. And then what I like to do is I like to choose a new icon for it. So we'll go we'll match it with the Whisper Flare one. But obviously it just works just works straight away with that Safari icon if you need it to. So you can see I've got open URLs. I'll probably change that to new quick notes a little bit later on. But you can see again if I click that now, you'll have to first permit Obsidian to be used. So you click allow there. And then straight away you're taken to your Obsidian app with a new inbox note that you can use Whisper Flow to transcribe into. So I'll show you that now. And it's pretty similar to on desktop. It takes a couple of extra setup steps for iOS, but they take you through that when you install the app. And so you'll open up your Whisper Flow keyboard, start your flow, you're taken to the app, and then back. And now I'm transcribing. So I'm transcribing some new content into this inbox note. And I don't even need to type, which is good because I can't type when I walk anyway. And once you're done with that, you click that you're done. And it transcribes instantly into your mobile inbox. And that is about the the ins and outs of how I capture information now on my desktop and on my mobile using this new app as part of my workflow. And it's very very quick and simple. once you've got it set it up, which is fantastic because like I just made a joke of then I'm not very good at typing when I'm on the move. Sometimes I don't want to type when I'm on the move. And this is a fantastic substitute. We'll go over where you can add this iOS shortcut now to be able to take these quick notes from anywhere. You can add them to your lock screen. And I'll show you what this shortcut is for me in a moment. But what I'll show you is first you can edit your lock screen. Click customize. You go into there, you add a shortcut widget. And then in that widget, you'll be able to tap the actual widget and select that you want your shortcut of choice to be placed there. And so once that's done, you can then launch that and have a brand new inbox note straight from your lock screen. You can add it as an icon on your home screen by um if you click that three dots icon, then you should be able to do it. If you click the down button at the top, you put add to home screen and then click add. And then you're able to open up a new note from your home screen as well, which is really useful. And last of all, you can do it from the control center too. So you hold down on your control center, click add a control, and then go to uh shortcuts. So you click select shortcut. You choose your shortcut open URLs and then you will have that there and again it's a new new note. So once you've integrated this with your iOS shortcuts, it's very easy to just be able to create a new note and speak into your phone at any point that you want. And it's easier than typing. So you can do it on the move, you can do it when you're speaking to somebody. So I found this really really frictionless in comparison to what I've had to do before which up to this point was typing. So even the fact that that is just removed is very very useful. I will show you that final shortcut on my lock screen now and what that is. So to add that to your lock screen, what you need first is another iOS shortcut which I will show you now, which is this one here, take flow note. So if I show you the menu, all you have to do to create that is click new shortcut. And then when you've got Whisper Flow installed, you go take flow note like that. And that's all you have to do. That's a another brand new shortcut there that will do exactly the same thing. But once you've got that set up, you add it to your lock screen in the same way we just did the quick note. And this is it on the left here. And what you want to do there is once you've got that from your lock screen, you can click that new note. And you can see how that notification at the bottom has now changed and it's now transcribing exactly what I say and will show it in the flow app, which I'll show you in a moment, which is fantastic because you don't even have to unlock your phone now to take a note. And now it's not saved to Obsidian. But if I finish this note here and click save, then what we can do is we can go to the Whisper Flow app. And here is this top note that is exactly what we've just spoken to our lock screen. And if we were to want to save it to Obsidian, all we've got to do is long press it, click that copy, and because we've got our other note configuration set up, we straight away open an inbox note in Obsidian. Paste your text, and you are in business there as well. That is just about rounding up the entire configuration of Whisper Flow that I use to take notes on my mobile device and on my desktop. And it's been so useful. I mean, I'm somebody who is very, very wary when it comes to introducing new software into my stack. So, I mean, I've stuck with Obsidian for years now. Even though I was chronic kind of shiny object syndrome app, which at the start, I've stuck with Obsidian, I've stuck with a lot of different apps for a long time and not really been into adding anything new into the stack. But, Whisper Flow I discovered a number of months ago now, and it's been absolutely fantastic for this that I've described in this video, and loads of other things, too. So, I'm more than happy to have added that into my software stack as well. And so, that's the end of the video. And as I mentioned previously, I'm working on a new PKM for students course. Seeing as just the other day, I finished my very, very last day and exam at university. And as you can see, I'm somewhere new now. I'm back home living with my parents for the time being until I or my friend finds a job and then we can move out. We're planning to move to to Reading near London. And anyway, with all that being said, I've finished studying and I'm putting together a course that goes over personal knowledge management for students. And if you want to be notified when that course goes live and also get a free twoe email course that talks about that system that I described earlier in the video when I was on my desktop. LM projects areas resources archive inbox which is Forte's power method with a zettocast and as the areas folder then you can click the top link in the description and learn more about the system which I call parasetle and be notified about that new course release when you provide me just with your email and you'll get it sent through and you can subscribe at any time if you don't like what I'm sending you. Um, but other than that, that has been me and thank you for watching and I will see you soon."

It's a lot. And the scary thing is that as you grow, it doesn't slow down. It actually speeds up. And that's why I started using Whisper Flow. It's a voice power tool that turns your thoughts into clean, polished writing. Everything from email drafts, caption ideas, video scripts, and even GPT prompts. All you have to do is speak and then flow understands exactly what you mean, turning it into clear, usable writing. So why does this matter? Well, as you know, being a creator means wearing every single hat. That involves being a filmer, writer, editor, strategist, communicator, and all of the above. And Whisper Flow takes the pressure off your hands and lets your voice do the work. It'll help you organize your content ideas before you forget them. It'll help you stay connected with your community and answer to DMs and comments faster. It'll give you more time to be creative instead of having to micromanage everything. You can reply to brands and collabs without having to stop your day. And most importantly, you can stay consistent and focused even when you're tired or creatively blocked. Whisper Flow isn't just a timesaver. It's what helps you keep going without burning [Music]"

So Whisper Flow is a tool which will help you automatically transcribe your words into text and it will also manage edge cases of when you stutter and if you're saying something which you don't want to say but it will automatically kind of infer what you want to say. So let me just tell you how it works. Uh let's say if I just come to a tool where there's an input box or where there's a place to type, I can just say the effects of AI after 4 years in politics, science and arts. So you saw how efficiently it just transcribed and how fast it did. Now let's say if I have a few bullet points. Tell me the context of number one politics, number two science and number three arts. You saw how the transcription tool automatically made a very nice prompt for your claude. Now after that I can press enter and it automatically cla with all sorry claw with will automatically do its matching. And now coming back to whisper flow. Now you see that it also keeps a history. You can copy it or you can try retrying or you can also do the AI edit and you can also download the audio. Now coming back to nodes, you can have a few notes in here and yeah now this is a very cool feature. Let's say if I say by the way anywhere it will automatically pick BTW. You can set up your vocabulary and then there are snippets as well. Let's say if I say personal email then it will automatically pick a personal email. uh the snippet which I have set here in my case it is user rate example.com so these are a few cool features of whisperflow now even in Google searches or in your browser you can just say top seven places to visit will automatically put that in your Google search and you can just percent and yeah so this is it you can check the pricing here but it's almost free 2,000 words are free even after that there's It's a lot free but yeah you know if you need to just go ahead then you can also choose the pro plan.

        "srt": "All right, let's settle this. Whisper Flow and Aqua AI are two very different tools, but both promise to save you time. Which one's right for you? Stick around and I'll break it down fast. First up, Whisper Flow. This is all about ditching your keyboard. Speak naturally and it turns your voice into polished text four times faster than typing. It works everywhere. Emails, Slack, even coding in VS Code. The AI cleans up filler words, matches your tone, and supports 100 plus languages. Need a personal touch? It learns your jargon like names or niche terms. Pricing starts free, 2,000 words a week, with Pro at $15 a month for unlimited dictation. Perfect for writers, devs, or anyone who thinks faster than they type. Now, Aqua AI. This one's a powerhouse for software hers. It automates the boring stuff, turning requirements into test cases, generating test data, even spotting duplicates. Just describe what you need, and Aqua AI builds it in seconds. It's a lifesaver for QA teams, cutting test life cycle time by 42%. Plans start at $8 a month for requirement management, scaling to $12 a month for full test suites. If you're drowning in Jira tickets or manual testing, this is your escape hatch. So, who wins? If you're drowning in words, emails, docs, code, Whisper Flow is your mic drop upgrade. But if you're battling bugs and test cases, Aqua AI is the automation hero. Both slash hours off your work week. Just pick the problem you hate most. That's it. No fluff, just the facts."

        "srt": "So, if you're wondering which dictation tool might fit you better, Whisper Flow or Super Whisper, here's a quick breakdown. In plain language, Whisper Flow is designed for speed and flexibility. You can dictate right into apps like Gmail, Slack, or even code editors, and it claims to be up to four times faster than typing. It's also smart about editing, can match the tone of what you're writing, and supports over a 100 languages. A nice extra is that it builds a custom word list, so it remembers unusual terms you use often. The free plan gives you a 2,000word weekly limit. And if you go pro at $12 a month, you get unlimited use, plus more editing tools. The downsides, sometimes it doesn't play perfectly with every app, and if you talk a lot, that free cap might feel tight. Super Whisper, on the other hand, leans into privacy. It runs offline, keeps everything stored on your device, and produces neat transcriptions with proper punctuation. It works well if you're recording in noisy spots, and it can even tidy up spoken notes into emails or documents. The basic version is free, while $849 a month gives you access to cloud models and translation features. On the flip side, the mobile app could be smoother, and with really long dictations, you might need to stop and restart once in a while. So, which one should you go with? Whisperflow makes sense if you want something fast, featurerich, and integrated with your workflow. Super Whisper is the better pick if privacy and offline use are more important to"

        "srt": "But don't just take my word for it. Here's what other students have to say around campus about Whisper Flow. It's quick. It's easy. You just speak and it just it pops up like magic, you know. How does this compare to using a keyboard or having to type everything out? This was super easy and it actually got everything I said perfectly written in there with commas and everything. Dear professor, I will not be going to class today. Um, I got into a car accident. My my arm got chopped off. I'm going to fly. I'm I'm all over the place. And I You see it removes all the ums and buts. Oh, that's pretty cool, actually. That's sweet. And here are some of my favorite ways to use Whisper Flow. First is summarizing lectures and notes. Just speak your takeaways right after class and instantly turn your words into type notes so you never miss a key point. Secondly is writing academic papers, or even code. Again, just talk through your ideas, whether it's an essay outline, a grant application, or debugging code. Whisper Flow transcribes it all so that you can say goodbye to endless typing. And last, but definitely not least, one of my personal favorites, which is drafting teacher and peer emails. Whether you need to send an email to professor or some feedback to a classmate. Just dictate your message and Whisper Flow converts your voice into a polished draft ready to send. No more typos, email anxiety, or messing around with keyboards. Whisper Flow free up hours in your day so that you can spend more time doing the things that matter and spend less time stuck behind the keyboard. So, the real question is, what are you waiting for? I'll see you on campus."

        "srt": "I used to really hate writing long prompts in my AI tools like chat GPT or claude and you know it was would make typos. I would lose my train of thought. It would be just like a consuming task. Then I discovered whisperflow which is able to take everything that I said and it's able to pretty much transfer it into proper formatted correct text. Hey, if we haven't met yet, I'm Mo from SAI and we build voice agents for small to mediumsiz businesses. And if you're interested to see how the technology could actually look into your business, then I do invite you for a free consultation. I leave links in the description below. And with that said, let's jump right into it. So yeah, here is the landing page of Whisper Flow. And to be clear, I'm not affiliated with this company at all. I just really love what they have offered. Um, and just want to share how much it changed the way that I interact with LLM models. So the idea is that you are let's say faced uh with claude or chd and the beautiful thing is that you're just able to pretty much click and you just talk out loud. So that means that you're able to really put out everything that you have in your head and you're able to give it as context into the LLM model of choice which in turn is going to really improve the way that you're going to um interact with the LM and thus the outputs are going to be as close as you know you actually wanted. So yeah, now if I type back, you can see that I will receive everything that I said. Um, and it's especially useful for example when it comes to brainstorming. So if you have a few ideas scattered around your head, um what I personally like to do is actually just like talk out loud, keep it there, have pauses, think and then let's say just overall ask the LM to then you know like give you a structured uh you know way to think about what you just said. Um or you you know you have something that is perhaps difficult to explain in writing. So what you do is that you just talk it out loud. And I found myself that it's really helping um when it comes to the uh also the thinking process that goes through it. And another handy way to use this tool is actually you know to respond to any email or any message that you receive like WhatsApp or personal or whatever. Um and you would just like quickly uh type it. And for those of you that are, let's say, like very specific and you want to be clean and clear when you write something, you just like type out or like dictate out what you want to respond with and just like go to FL LM or JP then ask it to improve what you uh your message uh essentially. So that is a really handy way uh to use whisper flow as well. And a interesting way that I actually like to use it is also when it comes to my sales preparation. So if I know that I have a sales call tomorrow and I want to be prepared um I try to go through let's say the outline of the sale the sales call uh and I just talk it through and I realize that whenever I talk it through I tend to have like diff different observations that I might not have thought of um if I just stayed in my head and had to type it or write it. So it's a really beautiful thing to like train but also yeah find different nuances um that you could leverage in your uh sales call and then you put it into the LM prop then it could think for you like in a more u dynamic way so you could find different pockets um of you know insights that you might have not realized yourself and it's really good to give you feedback um on let's say the approach that you want to Um so I really advise to use it for uh let's say this sales uh let's say preparation it can be really really handy. All right so with that said that was it for the introduction of whisper flow. Uh I hope this tool can be beneficial. Um if you've never used such a thing and I mean you don't have to use whisper flow necessarily. You could even just like go into the envel. Yeah, exactly. So, you're able to directly dictate what you want and yeah, it's it's a really good way to just like leverage uh let's say this feature to give context to VLM so it can really help you battle out. Cool. With that said, I thank you so much. Hope this was helpful and see you in the next"

        "srt": "If someone were to ask me today, what's the one AI tool that I cannot live without? My answer is simple. It is this tool right here: Wispr Flow. It's an AI-powered dictation tool that lets you speak naturally. You know the way that we normally speak? Well, we're not trying to sound perfect. For me, that's messy; that's chaotic. Scrambled thoughts, all that jazz and basically Wispr Flow takes that and cleans it up and turns it into a polished message ready to send. Think about this. Most tools expect us to adapt to them, but Wispr Flow flips that. It adapts to you. It adapts to the way that you think, and the way that you talk. If communication is a part of your day, then this tool is going to fit right in seamlessly. I don't want to waste any more time. Let's dive right into the demo. Because you're going to see very quickly how powerful this tool can be. So let's do it. I'm excited. Let's do it. This is just going to show you how I use Wispr Flow in my everyday workflow. There's two ways. You can simply just hold down a shortcut command key, which in my case would be function. And you hold it down. You start talking, and when you're done, you release, and voila! That's one way to do it. Or you could do the hands-free mode, which works really great for me. I'm Italian, I like, you know, moving around with my hands, and being excited. And that works really great. The good thing is, both of these are key commands that could be customizable on your keyboard. I'm going to just use function on mine, because I'm going to just hold it down the entire time and let's do it. Okay, so quick update for the team. I think we should shift the homepage redesign deadline to Friday, but only if the dev team is okay with that. Also, lunch plans changed. I thought it was noon, but it's actually going to be 12:30 at. Wait. Hold on. I think it's 626 Sacramento Street. I'll double check. Anyways, let's plan on regrouping after lunch and I'll circle back with the design stuff then. I remove my hand. Now check this out. Here's what Wispr Flow is actually doing. All right. It's not rewriting everything, but what it is doing is it's, you know, cleaning up the formatting. It's fixing the punctuation. And this is all in real time. And so instead of this messy voice to text dump, now we're getting a clean, readable message that is ready to go. No edits needed. And I just want to read what it is now. Okay. And I'm going to just make this a little bit bigger if I can. Yeah that looks better. Right now it says quick update for the team. I think we should shift the home page redesign deadline to Friday, but only if the dev team is okay with that. Also, lunch plans changed. I thought it was noon, but it's actually going to be 12:30 at 626 Sacramento Street. I'll double check. Let's plan on regrouping after lunch and I'll circle back with the design stuff then. Voila. I mean, that's pretty sweet, right? I'm into that. And I just want to show you really quickly hands-free mode. The big key differentiator is you're going to notice at the bottom of the screen when I hit hands-free mode, you're going to notice that it's going to have a new little icon at the bottom. And it's going to have a little X, and it's going to have a little stop button. And that's how you know you're in a hands-free mode. So I'm just going to show you that really quickly. So for me, mine’s function spacebar, and just pay attention to the bottom of the screen. Now, see there it is. Whoa, I'm just talking, trying to show this demo. And I really want people to be excited about Wispr Flow. And I want all my friends to use it and see the power of how amazing and seamless this tool is for their workflows. Okay. That's all I got. Peace out. I’m going to stop it. See, there it is. Whoa. I'm just talking, trying to show this demo, and I really want people to be excited about Wispr Flow and I’m And I want all my friends to use it and see the power of how amazing and seamless this tool is for their workflows. Okay. That's all I got. Peace out. I'm going to stop it. So there you have it. Okay, I just think this is so cool. Alright, let's just say that I want to actually edit this. This is where command mode comes in. This is where the real fun of Wispr Flow comes in. And this is going to be in the Pro model. So, you would have to have a subscription. But I do really think it's worth showing in this demo, just so that you can kind of see how powerful this tool can be. I have this text that we just worked on, and I want to, I don't know, make it more concise and I don't know, let's add emojis to it. You literally highlight the text like so. You have a new shortcut command. And for this it's going to be for me. Function and command. All you do is this I'm going to hit function and command and I'm going to say this, Make this more concise, sound more professional, and add emojis. It's kind of contradictory, right? But hey it might. I mean check that out. Now let's just say I don't want the emojis., and I want to make sure that this is in email form. I literally I'm just trying this on the fly as we're doing this. So let's try it. Okay. Let's remove the emoji. I'm sorry. Let's remove the emojis. Let's make sure that this is an email format. And let's address it to John. It's thinking. And here we go. Dear John, we're considering shifting the homepage redesign deadline to Friday pending dev team approval. Lunch plans have changed to 12:30 at 626 Sacramento Street. Let's regroup after lunch to discuss design details. Best regards. But it doesn't know who I am, so I never gave it from who. So we can say from Nicole. This, in my opinion, is the true power of Wispr Flow. Because it's allowing you to stay focused on the task at hand. And to me, that is a true productivity hack. You can improve your writing without even having to leave the application that you're in. Hands down, such a great feature. I love this so much. All right, I'm going to show you this feature that I think is honestly probably one of my favorites. We're going to do a little hypothetical here. We're going to use this, fictional character named Maile. And we're going to say this is your friend, and they have a unique spelling to their name. I don't know if that's going to be the spelling. Okay. Let's see if it gets it. I'm going to delete that. Just I don't want to trigger it. I don't want it to give it any clues. Let's see how does. Hey babe, I'm going to go meet Maile for dinner tonight. I just wanted to give you a heads up. I left some leftovers in the fridge for you. All you got to do is just pop it in the oven and warm it up and you should be good to go. I love you, and I'll catch up with you when I get back. So, it's spelt incorrectly the way that I wanted it to be spelled. That's amazing, but let's just say, this isn't how we want it to be spelled. So here's what's really cool. I'm going to actually make this bigger, just so we can see this for the demo. Let's just say that's not how you spell it, okay. And let's say, that we need to spell it this way. We're going to go: M A I L E E, and let's see if that works. And no you know what? Actually, let's just do it that way, Maylee. How about that? This is how we spell it, Maylee. Now, I'm going to just reread this again, and let's see if, now, when I say this, if Wispr Flow. Look it, check that out. It actually did it. Did you see that? That was quick. So I'm going to just show you this really quick. Hey babe. I'm going to meet. See, I can't even do this. Hey, babe. Actually, here you can see me messing up all in real time. Get rid of all that. I'm starting now. Hey, babe. I'm going to go meet Maylee for dinner tonight. I just wanted to give you a heads up. I left some leftovers in the fridge for you. All you got to do is just pop it in the oven and warm it up, and you should be good to go. I love you, and I'll catch up with you when I get back. Let's see if it actually. Look at that. It remembered. And not only did it remember, it totally realized that I screwed up; that all that beginning part, and broomed it. That is the power of Wispr Flow in real time. No preparation. Real example. My work here is done, friends. My work here is done. But it's not. I'm going to show you what's really cool. And that is, if you ever have to go and adjust a unique spelling. Wispr Flow gets it. And I just want to make sure you see this, because this is going to be the interface that you will see when you download, Wispr Flow onto your system. I want to just bring up the dictionary right here, and this little star, like this emoji, here. You can see it says flow learn this word automatically. So, I changed it one time. And now it's like I set it and forget it. Done. I think that's the kind of small detail that makes this feel built for real world communication. You know, it's again adapted to us, not the other way around. And that, like I said, is just such a game changer for my everyday use. This is that wrap up moment. How about this? Try it out. Download it. Stop typing. Start talking. Yay! Okay. I almost knocked my mic off. So, there we go. That's my ending. Thank you so much for listening. Peace and love. Ciao."

        "srt": "Hey, welcome back to the channel. Today I got something that changed my life. No lie, totally changed my life. About a month ago, I had a coaching call with someone and he showed me a tool he was using called Aqua Voice, I think. And I had never seen anything like it, but it was a voice dictation tool to computer that ran the thing that you dictate through AI and then pasted it. And I took a look at the one that he was using and it was like pulling a thread into all of these different tools that people are making to do this. And the best one I found is called Whisper Flow. And I did my due diligence. I looked at all of them. There are a few out there and they're all pretty good. This is the one that was a game changer for me for a few different reasons. I'm going to give you a little tutorial today. And by the way, um, if you do download this, I don't I don't do affiliate sales stuff very often, but you can use my code and it's down in the description and you get $15 off or something when you get 2,000 words and I get $15 anyway. Blah blah blah. If you do decide to check this out, use my affiliate code down below. All right, so this is the website. And the first shout out is that the website is freaking awesome. They just got $30 million of funding from Menllo Ventures for the AI powered dictation app. And check out their site. Look at this motion in here. It's called Flow or Whisper Flow. And it's they got all the flow. Shout out to the designers. Honestly, it's so good. So, I want to just highlight the site. Uh you can go to it at whisperflow.ai. Again, you can check it out down in the description. All right, let me show you how this works. and what I use it for. All right, starting out, I just have a text edit document on here on my Mac and I have one key programmed as my flow key. When I push that key, it activates the flow AI. And you can maybe see it. It'll be a little small, but you can maybe see it on the bottom of my screen when I click. You might be able to see it. If not, there's a little indicator on the bottom of the screen. So, I'm going to go wherever my cursor is. That's where it will paste whatever I dictate. Now, it won't paste word for word what I dictate. It will paste it after it processes it through AI and confirms what I'm trying to say and changes what I needed to say or whatever, fixes the things that I fixed. So, check this out. If you have some meeting notes that you uh just finished a meeting with some clients and you're going to send a recap email. So, you might do something like this. By the way, I just pushed the button to activate flow. Yeah, you can see the little indicator down there. It's just a little simple little thing. Hey Sally, it was a super fun meeting. Thank you so much. Just as a recap, I know you had stated that you love comp number three, but Joan was uh partial to comp number two and wanted to see the button style from comp number two pushed into comp number three on the next round. We're going to take care of that and send you the next round on Friday. Actually, probably Monday. Okay. So, now you can see this is the difference between just normal voice dictation. Now, first of all, I'm going to delete this top part when I was talking and it had the little indicator part, but you can see this. Hey, Sally, it was super fun meeting blah blah blah. Joan blah blah blah said all those things. And remember at the end, I said, we're going to send that to you on Friday. Actually, we'll probably send it on Monday. Look what it did here. We're going to take care of that and send it send you the next round on Monday. It got rid of the Friday part. Flo recognized that I was correcting myself and and only put the one version. Now, this is the big difference between using this and like Siri on your uh voice dictation because it's it recognizes when you fix something and doesn't just dictate or type what you dictated. That's a game changer. You can actually talk and fix things as you go. Let me show you another thing that you do with this. So, here it didn't it didn't format this like I would want. I'm going to go in and tell Flo to format this as an email with bullet points. And when you do that, you can do it as a command. So, when I push my button, instead of just starting to talk, I'll say hey flow. And hey flow means I want you to do something with the text that I have written right here. Hey flow. format this like an email and use bullet points for the copy sections. And then I let go and wait one second. These take a little longer because it's processing it through the AI. It has to read what you wrote and then process it. But you can see that it says, \"Thank you for a fun meeting. Recap of preferences blah blah blah. We will send you the next round on Monday.\" Now, this isn't ideal. um I would have done just the body part and I would have left the hey Sally part on there. So there are places where you have to be careful on what you do but uh it is better than using Siri voice dictation and this thing keeps getting better and better and better over time. It's already gotten some major improvements since I started using it just uh four weeks ago or something like that. So I'm going to just go back to this and paste that. Now, let me show you the next thing that I use this for. Uh, I use this often times just as my chat GPT prompt. So, I'm going to go in here to chat GPT. And I hardly ever type into chat GPT anymore. So, I'm going to go in here and paste that copy that I just had. Actually, you know what? I'm going to do it as new copy in here. I'm going to send an email to Sally with recap notes from the meeting we just had. So, hey Sally, thanks so much for meeting. I know you loved comp number three. Joan loved comp number one. You both agreed that we would take the button style from comp number one, integrate it into comp number three, and then when we deliver comp or round number two coming up, we will have those changes reflected and we should be off to the races. So, thanks so much for the meeting. It was super fun. We're excited about where this project is going. All right. So now I pasted this in here. And here is the polished version that Chat GPT gave me. So this is my voice dictation using Flow and then Chat GPT gave me this polished version that I would just copy and paste right into my email. Um I could also just go in here and this is what I do a ton. Thanks so much. reformat this as bullet points for the body section. And then I click that in chatpt. It knows what was pasted above. And then here are the bullet points. And then this is ready to go. Now my suspicion is that flow over time is going to do a lot of this itself. You're going to be able to do this using flow. There are some times when you still have to kind of process things through chat GPT, which I don't actually mind. and I got chatpt open all day long anyway. Okay, now let me show you the actual reason that I chose Whisper Flow over all of the other options. And it's because there is an iOS app that you can use. So, I'm going to open up my uh notes doc in my phone. And you can see here it's blank. And on the bottom, when you install the iOS app, there is a whisperflow dictionary. Let's get this to focus here. See that whisperflow dictionary? I have the dictionaries highlighted. And there's a whisper flow dictionary. And then that black button, that is the microphone button up there on the kind of mid left of the screen. Actually, it's the right of the screen. I will push that microphone and then flow will be working. So, I'm in my notes app on my phone. Hey, Sally. Uh, here's the meeting notes. We love the meeting. You like comp 3. Joan like comp one. We're going to migrate those two together, merge them together, and give you round two. We'll present that on Monday. Actually, we'll present it on Friday. And then let's get this to paste in here. You can see that flow did a good job of getting that dictation. And you can do all the same things, the hey flow, etc. that you would do on your computer, but you do it in here. Now, fun fact, I reply. I get a lot of messages. A lot of messages from MCA in my community. I get a lot of messages from MCA VIP crew, uh, in my text messages, and I'm replying to everything using voice dictation. And a lot of times it's at the end of the day when I go and lay my hammock and, uh, just reply to all my messages using Whisper Flow and then verbally saying it. and it fixes all my little things and it spells everything right and it adds all the punctuation where I need it. It is freaking lifechanging. Okay, let me show you one last feature that I love about Flow and I'm going to go back to my computer screen here. Um, okay. So, I have right here chatgpt open. Now, if I push a command key along with my programmed whisperflow button, then it goes into AI answer mode where it's going to listen to what I say and then give me information about it like uh and by processing it through perplexity AI. So, watch this. I'll push command and my flow button. What's the difference between a hippopotamus and a rhinoceros? And when I let go, it opens up perplexity and it gives me searching for the differences gives me all of the information that I would want from an AI about the difference between a hippopotamus and a rhinoceros. YouTube videos, uh, text, a grid here. So you can use this just to with a with a twob button push get answers from chat GPT. Well, it's not chat GPT. You can get answers from perplexity. Now another way that you do this is the same way that you're using AI now for things like code snippets. So watch this. I need some code, CSS code about how to highlight text using CSS for a web page. And here it opens up. I need some CSS code. It gives me the mark tag. Gives me my gives me what like four different five six different ways that I can do that using CSS. and it drops it all in there. So, talk about speeding up production. It's that stuff that you would be typing to get or type it in Google and you just get it right there. Literally anywhere that you have your cursor, it is going to process that through Whisper Flow when you dictate using that key. It's a total game changer. Okay. Okay, the final thing that I want to show you is the WhisperFlow Hub app that is on your computer or your iOS device. There's a little app that's installed and it creates a custom dictionary. It also has notes that you can dictate for quick thoughts and all of the historical things that you've dictated right here. And I'm going to go into this dictionary and show you here that these little ones with the little yellow star next to them are ones that Whisperflow added because I corrected something. So here's an example. Jenny. Jenny is traditional spelling of the name Jenny, but she spells it Jenn. Jenny's a new member in MCA VIP and uh she's an awesome agency owner. uh just super good, super talented person. Anyway, I corrected her name a couple of times and Whisper Flow recognized that I was correcting it, so it added it automatically to my dictionary. And now when I say Jenny, it will spell it Jenn. I can delete those or modify any of these right here. Another one that I added that was not added by Whisperflow because it doesn't have the little yellow stars next to it is more palooa. Mor Palooa is our retreat coming in London in September for MCA and it's Mor Palooa is gonna be freaking awesome. But that was a word that it didn't know how to spell that. It's a madeup word. So I had to put that into the dictionary so that when I dictate that word it spells it correctly. In fact, I'm going to go and show you that right now. Hey Jenny, you should come to more Palooa in London September 10th to the 14th. So now you can see it dictated that as Jeene Nie E and more Palooa spelled it correctly here and gave the dates. So pretty slick custom dictionary fixes all your stuff. It's such a game changer for me. So anyway, check it out. Whisper flow. I use it for everything. I may never type again. Ever. Ever. Works on my phone. Works on my computer. I'm like talking in my phone all the time like this to dictate. Uh it's freaking amazing. It's amazing. So check it out. Use my affiliate code.

        "srt": "What if you could type perfectly just by talking into your phone or computer? Seriously, I'm not just talking about regular voice to text that gives you a hot mess of filler words and awkward phrasing. I'm talking about an AI powered voice dictation app that listens to how you actually speak and turns it into polished writing that sounds like you only better. [Music] Hi, I'm Samantha. Here to help online coaches, freelancers, and other small service-based entrepreneurs organize and streamline their business operations so they can save time, mental energy, and focus on what they love to do. So, Whisper Flow is the first voice app I've used that feels like it actually gets how I think. And there's one feature I absolutely have to show you, especially if you use a sauna because this fix is something I have been wanting forever. So, in this video, I'm going to walk you through exactly how Whisper Flow works from real world examples to pro tips that'll save you serious time. Plus, I'll share how I use it in my daily work as a service provider, content creator, and busy mom running a business. So, let me know in the comments. Have you tried voice dictation apps before? Which ones? and what did you like or dislike about them? Okay, so Whisper Flow just launched on iOS and if you're not using it already, you're missing out on one of the fastest, cleanest, and most intuitive voice tools I've tested. So, it lets you speak naturally like you're leaving a voice memo to a friend. And it writes what you actually meant to say. It edits out the ums and h. It adds punctuation automatically and even adapts how it writes depending on the app you're in. It's really awesome because you can use it inside your email app, DMs, notes, Slack, notion, even a sauna, which I'll show you soon. I'm going to demo how it works in a few real world apps, share a couple advanced features like course correction and command mode, and wrap up with how I've personally been using this to get through emails, content planning, and daily business ops way faster. So, here's the deal. Most voice to text apps just transcribe you word for word. That's not super helpful when you speak like a human, not like a punctuation robot. Flow is built to bridge that gap. It listens to you speak naturally. It writes polished, structured sentences, and it formats your thoughts into text that actually makes sense to a reader. You don't need to memorize weird voice commands for punctuation. You don't need to reread every line to fix it up after. And if you change your mind mid-sentence, flow just goes with it. It's super cool. So, for example, if I say, \"Let's meet tomorrow.\" Actually, let's do Friday instead. So, you can see it writes that as a clean, corrected sentence without the messy trail of corrections. Super cool. Okay, so I want to walk you through how to actually use Flow because once you know the basics, it's super easy to integrate into your day. So, let's get into how I use it on my computer. Okay. So, to start dictating, all you do is you click into where you want the text to be, where you would normally type, just like you normally would to start typing, but instead of starting typing, uh, all you do is you hold down the hotkey. So, on Mac, it's the Fn key. And these can be changed, too, by the way, in the settings. Um, and then on Windows, it's control and then the Windows key held together. So, I'm on Windows, so I'm going to go control Windows. And then you'll see this little this little bar down here, this little bubble, and you can see that it's recording what I'm saying. And then you just hold it, you speak naturally, and when you're done, you just release it and give it a second. And then it pops up right there. Super fast. It instantly converts what you have said into polish polished text and it pastes it right where your cursor, right where you clicked, right where you wanted your uh text to be. And you see it adds punctuation and everything. And it even knows that I didn't finish my sentence because I did stop it mid-sentence. You can also turn on hands-free mode so you don't have to continue to hold those keys down the whole time you're talking. This is helpful for like longer writing sessions. So all you do for that is you go control windows or whatever your hotkey is and then push the space bar and then let go. That's all you have to do. I'm letting go right now and I'm talking and you see it's recording me. Um, and then you can just uh hit the hotkeys again to stop it and then it will transcribe it once again. You can also um click this little bubble down here to start dictating. You see once I hover over it, it says click to start dictating. You can click there. It's recording me. You can click stop to finish and paste what you said. This is a lifesaver if you are brain dumping into notes, drafting a long email, or writing content where you just want to talk it out without worrying about the keys. Okay, now let's talk about settings for a second because when I first installed Flow, I I'll be honest, I found the little floating bubble here um to be kind of annoying and it was actually like up here randomly. So, that might uh happen to you as well. So, in case it does and in case you also don't love it, don't love it on your screen at all times when you don't need it. Um, and especially since you can just use hotkeys to activate it even without this bubble being here. Super awesome, by the way. Um, then you can totally turn that off. So, you just go into flow, open up the window, and then go into your settings here and then go into system. And then this one here, there's other settings here as well that you can look through, but this one is the one I'm talking about. Show flow bar at all times. So you can toggle that off and you see it disappear down here, right? Um, super handy. I much prefer it that way. Although I don't mind it as much down here as I did like in the middle of my screen like it was initially. That was a bit annoying. Okay. And then while you're in the settings, you can also change your hotkey if the default feels awkward or just not something you want to have. So here in defaults, so you can set your default keyboard shortcut, change shortcut. So you can choose whatever you would like. Same with hands-free mode. Um, you can, uh, change that in there. You can choose your preferred languages. And you can also add words to your dictionary in here. So, for example, it didn't pick up a sauna. It had like a sauna. You know, the sauna that you go into and and get all sweaty and stuff, that kind of sauna. So, I had to change it to that. And now it works perfectly when I'm talking about a sauna. Um, and the same with my name and my email, any other names or any other odd words, and you can add into your dictionary at any time, which is really awesome. So, as you can see, Flow is super customizable. It takes 2 minutes to poke around in these settings when you install it. And it's so worth it. And you don't even have to do anything with your settings to just get started using it. Seriously, when I first like tried it out and started using it, I was like, \"Really, that's it? That's all I have to do?\" It was just so easy and convenient, which is why I really wanted to show it to you so that you can start using it, too. Okay. And the really cool thing, another another really cool thing is it works in any app you're working in, which is such so huge. Um, let me show you how it works in some different tools that I regularly use. So, if we head over to Gmail, all right, so I open an email in Gmail and I can do the same thing. So, I'll just toggle on my hotkeys like so. And you'll see the bubble pop up when I'm talking. the bubble pops up when you have it toggled off to not show all the time. Um, instead of typing out a long response, you can speak it. Flow formats it into that clean professional um, typing. And this will save you so much time replying to client emails when walking on the beach or waiting in the car pickup line because mom life. So, I'll let go and it will transcribe what I just said. So cool. See, it's separated into paragraphs and everything. Okay, so I'm going to show you in WhatsApp because I honestly rarely use Slack, but Slack is another place that you can do this or any messaging app, right? Um, now WhatsApp does have the voice notes feature. As you can see, me and my assistant voice note back to each other lots. Um, but if you're not a fan of voice memos or just not the right time or situation for them, then Flow is perfect. You can, so I'm going to do it right now. Here you can speak your message. It writes clearly and you send it like a regular text. So if I let go now, fast, clean, and no audio clutter. Look, it even put a semicolon in there. So cool. Even random apps like this sticky notes app that I have my computer. You hold your hotkeys, start talking, and you'll see your thoughts appear instantly just like this without filler words, grammar mistakes, or weird formatting. How cool is that? Okay, now my personal favorite, of course, a sauna. So, seriously, I've said for years that a sauna needs a voice note feature. It drives me nuts that I can't just talk out a quick task comment when I'm multitasking or send out a voice note. There's one feature in the Sauna app, like on your phone, that lets you do voice to text, but only when creating a task, not for commenting or anything else. And there's no options for this on the computer. But guess what? With whisper flow now, you can do this anywhere in Aana. So for example, if I want to send a message to myself, um you can just open it up, start talking using flow. It writes perfectly, formatted, clear, way faster than typing it out. Just like this. All right. If I want to comment on something, same thing. game changer if you're managing multiple clients or leaving quick instructions for your VA. So awesome. Now, let's get into some of the prolevel features that make Flow even more powerful. So, there's push to talk versus hands-free. You can use push a talk mode. Just hold the mic button for quick stuff or turn on hands-free mode if you're writing a long dock or brain dumping notes. Then there's course correction, which I showed you earlier a little bit. If you change your mind halfway through a sentence, Flow handles that so smoothly. It listens for actually or wait and adjusts the sentence accordingly. You don't have to stop and start over. It has custom language and lingo, so Flow learns your phrases, acronyms, and even client names over time. Super handy if you use brand specific terms. It works in 100 plus languages. And if you're part of a global team or client base, that is huge. I personally love that it works great with international accents, too. Something other tools really struggle with. Then there's command mode. This one is fun. You can highlight a chunk of text in any app and say, \"Hey, flow.\" And give it a command, like, \"Make this friendlier.\" Or, \"Turn this into bullet points,\" and it'll rewrite it in the same tone. Honestly, tools like this are the reason I'm able to get so much done each week while still having time for beach days with my daughter or quick midday power naps because perry menopause. So, really awesome part is you can try it for free. You'll get a weekly word limit to start and if you want unlimited dictation, syncing between mobile and desktop, and bonus features like command mode, you can upgrade to pro. Honestly, the free version is more than enough to get started and see if it fits your workflow. Spoiler, it will. But you can also try out the pro features free for a whole month using my link. I'm so pumped that I got this for you. You can go to samantha.com/flow to get started and get that one month of the pro features for free. Yay. With their brand spanking new iOS app, it's super awesome as well. I will just show you. It shows you step by step how to uh configure it to get it set up and working. And it's super quick. It's just a couple steps and you're good to go. Basically, you just have to go into your settings and set it up as a new keyboard option. And then once you're in any app, right now I'm in Gmail, for example, and you just tap this little globe down here, and you'll see it pop up with options. So, you'll see I'm currently using the Swift Keyboard, but I can change it to Whisper Flow. And then I turn on this microphone button here. And now it is listening to me and it's going to translate what I am saying into text just like on the computer. It is so amazing. Just like this. See? And then if we head over to iotes, it works here as well. The keyboard is already activated. But if you want to go back to your old keyboard, you can easily do that as well just in this menu here. But if we want to use this in iotes, it's listening to me again. And it will again put what I'm saying into text just like this. Perfect. And most importantly to me of course is that it also works in the ASA app. So for example, if I want to comment on this task that I'm in, I can do that. Just hit the microphone button again and it's you see it's listening to me again and it's going to turn what I'm saying into perfectly structured text. So awesome. And there's one more thing that I want to show you. It's that you can actually whisper and it still catches what you're saying. Isn't that awesome, too? I love it so much. Such a huge fan. Such an amazing app. You got to try it on your computer and your app and everywhere. And it's going to save you so much time. Okay, so to wrap it up, Flow is smart enough to understand your natural speech. It's intuitive enough to work in any app, anywhere, and it's fast enough to save you hours each week, especially if you're running a business from your phone, like so many of us are. I am a big fan of Flow, and I'm so happy to share it with you today. So, if this sounds like the kind of tool that could save you time, or at least your thumbs, download Flow and try it out today. Okay, let me know in the comments where would Flow save you the most time in your business. All right, thank you. so much for watching. I hope you found this video helpful and I will see you next week."

        "srt": "You ever have one of those moments where your brain is racing with ideas, but your fingers just can't keep up on the keyboard? Yeah, same here. And that's actually what got me curious about this new tool called Flow. My name is Daniel, and in this video, I'm going to show you how Flow works, some of its coolest features like real-time speech cleanup and smart editing, how easy it is to set up, and of course, how much it costs, including what you get for free, and why the pro version might be totally worth it. Guys, make sure you check out all the useful links in the description after watching this video. There might be some nice discounts there. Let's dive in. What is Flow? So, here's the deal with Flow. It's basically this voice tool that lets you talk to your computer or iPhone like you're chatting with a friend. No more awkward robot commands or weird phrases you have to memorize. You just talk normally and it gets what you're saying. The whole idea is pretty simple. make talking to your computer feel as easy as talking to anyone else. It learns how you naturally speak and rolls with it. Now, here's where things get interesting. Most of us type at around 40 words per minute. But when you're using Flow, you're speaking at about 120 words per minute. That's almost three times faster. So, basically, you can get three times more stuff done in the same amount of time. Pretty cool, right? Think about it. Instead of being stuck pecking away at your keyboard, you're just talking at the speed your brain actually thinks. No more waiting for your fingers to catch up with your ideas. Now, let's take a closer look at the features this tool offers because I think they're awesome in their simplicity. Speech polishing. One of the greatest things about Flow is how it's able to clean up your speech in seconds. We've all been there, right? You're trying to say something important, but it comes out full of us, stumbles, and mistakes. Let me give you an example. Uh, hey everyone. Um, I just wanted to remind you about the meeting uh on Thursday. I mean, it's really important that we all uh try to be there. Uh, let me know if you have any questions. Flow fixes this in real time. It cuts out the a smooth stutters and fixes mistakes so you sound clear and professional. No awkward flubs. So, there you have it. Just a polished, perfectly streamlined text in seconds. Smart editing on the fly. Here's another thing that's really cool about flow. It handles those moments when you change your mind while talking. You know how sometimes you start saying one thing and then switch to something else? Flo gets it. Like if you say this, \"Hey Sarah, just checking. Does meeting up next Tuesday at Pete's Coffee?\" Or actually make that the daily grind work for you around 3 p.m. Wait, no. Better make it 1:30 p.m. Let me know. Instead of sending Sarah a messy message with all your back and forth thinking, Flo figures out what you actually want to say and cleans it up. So, she just gets a clear, straightforward message about meeting at the Daily Grind at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday. And the great thing about Whisper Flow is that it's even easier to use on your iPhone, on the go, anywhere, anytime. Whether you're walking to a meeting, sitting in a coffee shop, or just lying on your couch, you can pull out your phone and start dictating. The mobile experience is just as smooth and powerful as the desktop version, so you're never stuck waiting to get back to your computer to capture your thoughts. It's perfect for those moments when inspiration strikes or you need to quickly respond to something important while you're out and about. How to get started with Flow? Using Flow couldn't be simpler. First, head over to whisperflow.ai and download the software. Don't worry, you can do it for free. What I love about it is that it's pretty versatile. You can use it on Mac, Windows, or your iPhone. And once you've installed and downloaded it, you'll be able to access your dashboard. This is what it looks like. Here at the top of your screen, it shows your stats, like how many words you use so far or how fast you can dictate. For me, it's 139 words per minute right now, which is pretty impressive. Below, you can watch Flow in action and explore some use cases to see how much it can do for you. And here's a recent activity log. You can view all messages you've recorded so far. There's also a dictionary feature, so you can tell FL how to correct your misspellings, for example. And here you can even make quick voice notes if that's what you need. And remember, I said using it is super simple. Check this out. There's this small button at the bottom of your screen. It's always there no matter what you do, but you can always hide it so it doesn't get in the way. So whenever you need to dictate a message, you just click on it and it will start recording whatever you say. Or you can use a customizable hotkey if you don't feel like clicking on anything. Once you're done, it will just automatically paste your message. Neat, right? Guys, before we move on, I try to make my content fun instead of boring. And in return, please like this video and subscribe to my channel if you enjoy the content I make. How flow changes everything. Guys, think about all the typing you do every day. Emails, texts, documents, or even Google searches. It adds up to hours, right? Now, imagine doing all that stuff three times faster, making fewer mistakes, and not getting sore hands from all that clicking and typing. But here's the thing. Flow isn't just about being faster. It's about not breaking your train of thought. You know how sometimes you're thinking of something brilliant, but by the time you finish typing it out, you've lost the thread? That doesn't happen with flow. your thoughts go straight from your brain to the screen without getting stuck in your fingers. Pricing. Now, let's talk pricing. And don't worry, it's super straightforward. So, first off, Whisper Flow actually has a free basic plan. And honestly, it gives you quite a lot. You get 2,000 words per week, which is great if you are just using it here and there. You also get lightning fast voice typing, support for over 100 languages, privacy mode, flow for iPhone, and you can even add your own words to the dictionary if you're just testing things out or don't need it fulltime, the free version might be all you need. But, and here's the big one. If you really want to unlock its full power, the pro plan steps it up. It's $15 per month, and it gives you unlimited words, plus this awesome command mode that lets you edit as you speak. You also get early access to new features. priority on feature requests and everything from the basic plan. So, if you're using Flow a lot, especially for work or content creation, Pro is totally worth it. Now, if you've got a team, the team's plan brings the price down to $12 per user per month and adds stuff like admin controls, shared contacts coming soon, and centralized billing. You need a minimum of three seats, but it's great for businesses or remote teams since you get everything from Pro Plus those team features. But again, and I really mean this, if you're just getting started, that basic plan is way better than most free tools out there. You're not stuck with the 7-day trial. You actually get to use it week after week. Final thoughts. All right, so that's Flow in a nutshell. Fast, smart, and honestly kind of fun to use. Whether you're a writer, a student, someone working in tech, or just tired of typing all day, this tool can really take the pressure off and help you get more done without slowing down your brain. If you haven't tried it yet, seriously, go check it out. The free version is more than enough to get a feel for how powerful it is. And if you end up loving it like I did, the pro plan is there waiting for you when you're ready to level up. Let me know what you think in the comments. Have you tried Flow already? Are you thinking about switching to voice over typing? I'd love to hear how you'd use it. Feel free to check out the links in the description below. You might find some discounts there.

        "srt": "<b>If I told you that one tool could make</b> <b>you way more efficient</b> <b>in your day-to-day tasks,</b> <b>like browsing the web, crafting an email,</b> <b>or even replying to a Slack message,</b> <b>would you believe me?</b> <b>Well, it's totally true. And in this</b> <b>video, I'm going to introduce you to the</b> <b>tool to make that happen.</b> <b>Whisper Flow. Whisper Flow is the</b> <b>voice-to-text</b> <b>transcription app supercharged.</b> <b>And I think it's better for me to show</b> <b>you how it works before we can talk shop.</b> <b>So let me give you some examples on how</b> <b>Flow can simplify everyday</b> <b>tasks that involve writing.</b> <b>Let's say I want to do an email to my</b> <b>friend Eduardo. Check how fast this is.</b> <b>Helping buying furniture.</b> <b>Hey, Eduardo, my month's birthday is</b> <b>coming up, and I was thinking</b> <b>that you could truly help me</b> <b>out if you just come with me to the store</b> <b>and help me pick out</b> <b>something for her home.</b> <b>Talk to you soon, bro. Fernando.</b> <b>[click]</b> <b>And there you go. You see how quickly it</b> <b>was for me to write</b> <b>that email and how it's all</b> <b>formatted right away. Let's move on to</b> <b>another example.</b> <b>Perhaps I'm on Slack here,</b> <b>and I'm trying to send Umberto a message.</b> <b>Hey, Umberto, I saw you</b> <b>on the general channel,</b> <b>and I was super interested in your</b> <b>opinion about Flow. What</b> <b>have been some of your major</b> <b>use cases so far? Again, you see how the</b> <b>formatting is precise for</b> <b>the app that you're using.</b> <b>Before, when I was on email, you could</b> <b>see that the email formatting was</b> <b>applied, so it kind of</b> <b>split the \"Hey, Eduardo\" and the</b> <b>paragraph and the \"Goodbye\"</b> <b>whether when you're on Slack,</b> <b>it kind of looks like just a regular</b> <b>message that you would send someone.</b> <b>And that's all what</b> <b>Flow's doing in the background.</b> <b>So you got messages, you got emails, what</b> <b>else can you do with this thing?</b> <b>Well, I think browsing the web is another</b> <b>one of my favorite</b> <b>things. Let's say I'm in</b> <b>perplexity. Hey, perplexity, my MacBook</b> <b>Pro has been acting out a</b> <b>little weird. I hear the fans</b> <b>spinning even when I'm not doing anything</b> <b>with the computer and it's</b> <b>just sitting idle. So give me</b> <b>troubleshooting steps from A to Z on what</b> <b>I can do to potentially solve this issue.</b> <b>You saw how fast that was, just a bunch</b> <b>of context in there that</b> <b>this would take me like</b> <b>years to write. It's all formatted</b> <b>correctly. It's all nice and tidy there.</b> <b>Finally, let me show you</b> <b>another one of my usual use cases here.</b> <b>It's in my task manager,</b> <b>Ignotion. If I want to create</b> <b>a new task, for example, create meta</b> <b>campaign for new partner.</b> <b>That's going to be the task.</b> <b>And then I'm going to do the description.</b> <b>We onboarded a new</b> <b>partner in the Middle East</b> <b>last Friday, create meta campaigns for</b> <b>user recruitment within</b> <b>specific countries and it</b> <b>needs to be done by Tuesday the 13th.</b> <b>Okay, you see how fast</b> <b>that was, name of the task,</b> <b>description of the task, I can just set</b> <b>my due date. And that's it.</b> <b>So I'm hoping that you thought</b> <b>that that little demo was pretty cool.</b> <b>And then you can instantly</b> <b>see the value in having Flow</b> <b>help you make the things that you do</b> <b>every day, but a thousand</b> <b>times faster. But that's not all.</b> <b>If you're constantly on the move, well,</b> <b>Flow just released a new iOS</b> <b>app that will help you bring</b> <b>that Flow experience that you just saw in</b> <b>desktop to your phone. So</b> <b>let me show you how it works.</b> <b>And then we can continue talking about</b> <b>the details here. Okay, so here we are</b> <b>looking at my iPhone</b> <b>screen. And let's say I want to do a</b> <b>quick note. So I'm going to go into my</b> <b>notes right here. And</b> <b>to start Flow, all you need to do is go</b> <b>ahead and select the Flow keyword and</b> <b>click on Start Flow.</b> <b>And now I can just start transcribing.</b> <b>Hey, so I just want to remember my</b> <b>shopping list for later</b> <b>today. I need to get some oat milk, some</b> <b>ham, some bread, some olive</b> <b>oil. And you see, that was</b> <b>instantly transcribed into my notes. No</b> <b>problem. Also, let's go</b> <b>ahead and go through another</b> <b>example where I just open my email right</b> <b>here, compose real quick</b> <b>and go into my subject line.</b> <b>And again, enter to the Flow keyboard.</b> <b>Quick meeting one on one Friday.</b> <b>Aha. Hey, Guillermo, how you doing? This</b> <b>is Fernando. I just</b> <b>wanted to remind you that we</b> <b>should schedule a meeting with the rest</b> <b>of the team on Friday to</b> <b>go over the presentation for</b> <b>the new product. And that's going to also</b> <b>format it. So on the</b> <b>phone, it's kind of still rough</b> <b>around the edges sometimes, you see how</b> <b>it was not instantly formatted for my</b> <b>notes here, but how it</b> <b>did work here on the email. So that's</b> <b>kind of a trial and error</b> <b>kind of thing. But it's just</b> <b>amazing how fast it makes things go.</b> <b>Okay, guys, so there's really</b> <b>not much that I can show you</b> <b>in terms of how this flow work is</b> <b>extremely simple. And that's</b> <b>why I really can recommend it</b> <b>to you and to everybody. Basically, it's</b> <b>so simple that with your</b> <b>phone, it only requires you to do</b> <b>a couple of taps. And on desktop, you</b> <b>only have to use one or two</b> <b>shortcuts to activate the flow</b> <b>mode. And what it's doing, it's obviously</b> <b>using an AI model to</b> <b>transcribe, but also to auto correct</b> <b>and to auto format, depending on the</b> <b>context and the application</b> <b>that you're using. So Flow will</b> <b>know that you're using your email that</b> <b>you're using Slack, it will, of course,</b> <b>not take a screenshot</b> <b>of your application, but it will kind of</b> <b>get the data that you're</b> <b>using that one, and then use it</b> <b>to format its answers. At the same time,</b> <b>the flow model automatically</b> <b>correct any spelling mistakes,</b> <b>or if you kind of repeat a phrase twice,</b> <b>it will delete one of them</b> <b>most of the time. You know,</b> <b>if one year ago you came to me and asked</b> <b>me Fernando, what is</b> <b>the best AI voice to text</b> <b>transcription app out there? I would have</b> <b>told you super whisper. And</b> <b>I still believe that that's</b> <b>the best. I still use super whisper</b> <b>sometimes. But the thing</b> <b>about it is that it's extremely</b> <b>complicated, or at least way more</b> <b>complicated than flow. But if you all</b> <b>want to do is make your life</b> <b>easier on your day to day stuff, then</b> <b>this I think flow really</b> <b>takes the cake. And it really has</b> <b>surprised me over the last three months</b> <b>where I've been paying for the pro</b> <b>version, which is around</b> <b>$12 per month with education and</b> <b>nonprofit discounts available. I just</b> <b>think it's worth it.</b> <b>I always tell people first try it by</b> <b>yourself, you know, there are free</b> <b>versions available. In the</b> <b>case of flow, there's a free version,</b> <b>which basically just</b> <b>caps the amount that you can</b> <b>transcribe per week. So it's around 2000</b> <b>words for free. And that's</b> <b>plenty for you just to get the</b> <b>experience of how it feels day to day.</b> <b>And I think you won't be able</b> <b>to go back to regular keyboard</b> <b>life. So guys, go ahead, try flow out. If</b> <b>you want to see how I</b> <b>choose specific AI models for</b> <b>different tasks, then watch the video</b> <b>here at above. And if</b> <b>not, subscribe to the channel</b> <b>guys, please help me out at on I'll see</b> <b>you in the next video. My</b> <b>name is Fernando. Bye bye.</b>"

        "srt": "Today we're looking at an app called Whisper Flow.  It is one of these AI transcription tools. They basically work when you hold down a button and  you can essentially talk into it and it does it for you. It passes the information and then be  able to rescramble it to make it more better, more accurate and things like that. So, if I were  to go up to here, I could use the recording and I could hold down the function button and say  something like that. Use a recording and I could hold down and there we go. So, if I press finish,  it's obviously transcribed that very well. But you're probably wondering why is that different  to dictation abilities? Well, essentially this is going to help fix grammar, punctuation, improve  uh flows like for example, say you got snippets that you want to mention and also personalize it  as well and learn about you over time. So these type of apps are very popular. If you're looking  for loads of them, then you can find them below. However, if you want to just check out Whisper  Flow, you can find it linked below there, too. So, just so you know before we start this video. Now,  this app is available on Mac, iOS, and on Windows. It is coming to Android apparently. So another one  to consider. So let me show you around this app. Now as you can see up here, this is one of the  cool features about this. As you start using it, it will work out your average words uh per minute  and how many words you dictated as well as your streak and total apps which might be useful  to you. And you can see here I've got the pro trial. Now, as you can see in settings, you can  change a few things. There's actually something in here that you need to remember. With privacy,  there's two modes when you get up. So there's a privacy mode and a learn mode. The learn mode  trains or I I don't know whether it trains it learns to improve your usage of it but privacy  mode doesn't train the model which is helpful. So you can see here that's enabled. So just make  sure you have enabled it and you can check all the privacy data from here. Now as you can see there  are a few different other things like experimental mode vibe coding and you can pretty much use this  for whatever app you use on your device. So if I were to pop open an email let's give it a test  there. So, right, we're ready to go. I feel like I should be using there's another app in the space  called Super Whisper. When I'm using Superhuman, it just feels natural. So, I'm going to start  talking about this. I'm going to use the function button and I'm going to start talking and telling  you about how amazing the Bento Focus app is. If you've not yet downloaded it, I'd highly recommend  it cuz it's our app that we've built to help you better focus. So, there we go. And as you can see,  it's improved the grammar and also the punctuation of this, which is going to be helpful because that  is something that dictation doesn't do well. So, there's other abilities like personal email. So,  what you can do is say words like that inside of your message and it basically pulls in snippets  for you to use that are correlated to those ones. So, I'll try another one of those. Best focus  app in the world. It's accurate every time. I'm just kidding, guys. Enough of Bento Focus. But  you get the idea of that you can use a snippet step. They also have a feature called dictionary  where it's going to learn about you over time. So for example, in this case, you can add new words  and be able to share them with your team as well so that they can have correlated words. So if you  work in a company where jargon is very particular, then this might be something to be help set  things up. Now you can create your own notes in this area, which is a helpful feature, but largely  all the activity runs through the center here. So, you're probably wondering, how is this  even useful? How is this beneficial? Well, they've got a mobile app which will help you to  take the meeting notes through there. So, if you want to do a one-on-one person, that's going to be  helpful, but it also will help you to do your own personal notes as well. And you can also use this  desktop pretty much for whatever you want. So, if you're somebody that likes to ask clawed  questions while you're coding and you don't want to move your hands from the mouse or write  them out, then that's something you can do because you just have to hit that function button and it  jumps straight in. I have been starting to play with these type of apps in particular for email.  The reason being is because when I'm writing email and I'm in the office in a closed environment, I'm  just talking the email because it's so much easier and it normally gets the tone. It normally gets  the attributes and it just does it faster. If I was in a coffee shop, I probably wouldn't do  that. But at the same time, I find it's more humanlike if I'm starting to talk it out loud  as well. Sometimes it adds in tones like that's amazing or that's fantastic that I have said,  but it just dictates it more accurately. So, there are some pricing plans. So, you do get a  limit on the free plan. It's 2,000 words a week, which can be a limit for many people. And you  can add words to your dictionary as well as all of the abilities I've showed you here. The premium  pricing is $12 per month. That's unlimited words. And command mode editing as well. So, command  mode allows you to go in and edit stuff to be more accurate. So, if there's a section of text  that you want to improve, I do this all the time inside of email, then you can do that as well. And  you can also see unlimited mobile use, too. So, $12. Again, if you're aggressively using this,  is probably a considered bet for you. You can also change what your keyboard commands are as  well. So, if you want to do hands-free mode, you can do that. And that's just something you can  play with. So, Whisper Flow is an interesting app. If you're somebody that spends a lot of time  doing and managing email and you're good with your voice, for example, you like to just talk  sometimes versus actually do it. it's probably me, then these type of apps will be good for you.  There are a range of them, so I'll include as many as I can below. However, Whisper Flow. I like  how they set up with the function button. That's quite nice. The app was fluid to use in my tests.  And also, I quite like the statistical scores just cuz you're able to see, okay, words per minute.  Am I beating what score? Maybe it's just to give you an idea of how effective you are. So, I  think this is a good app worth checking out. and they're growing as a company apparently. I've been  keeping an eye on them as a startup like I do with many of them. But check them out in the link in  description if you're interested. And of course, Bento Focus too. Thanks very much and I'll  see you all very soon. Cheerio for now."

        "srt": "All right, everyone. I'm really excited today. It's the first of a series of new interviews that coming back to our YouTube channel and I started with a tool that I really love and in fact the CEO of the tool, Tana Kotari, here he is. >> Thanks for having me, man. Well, I'm pumped to go into this because uh whisper flow for those who don't know what this tool is, it is actually well people would call it dictation tool which I think is not giving it justification. It is doing much more than that. And I discovered whisperflow while I was doing coding and I started using whisper flow but our community and our audience are busy professionals. And that's where I very quickly realized man this is really saving time. Our co-founder Paco Cano he will never use an audio transcription tool because he's such a fast writer and he needs to think while he's writing. And I think that's something we need to discuss today. >> Who is really the target audience and who is it for? For me, it's I rather want to talk into my tool and then refine afterwards. So, I get my thoughts out there. Well, it's different types of thinking and as we do at the paperless movement, we talk about the difference between deep thinking and shallow thinking and especially when I do quick notes like or prompting. I use a lot whisper flow and it does so much more than other audio transcription tools. And before we dive in and then you can fire ahead, I just want to share the story here that I just today received a comment on YouTube below my whisper flow video where I showed the people how it works. Does it actually work with Thunderbird, my email provider, right? >> Or email app that I'm using. And I just responded, well, it doesn't matter what tool you use. As soon there is a text box, you can use it. And that's what makes it so versatile and easy to use. So Tanai, cannot wait to dive in. Maybe you introduce yourself and a bit more of the background and the story and why you ended up with Whisper Flow and then we go into the nitty-gritty, I'd say. >> Sure. Happy to dive in. So hey everyone, I'm T. I'm the CEO and co-founder of Whisperflow. And we've been working on Whisper Flow for the last one and a half years. But for me, it's been something that I've been working on for the last 18 years, which is what is the next generation of personal computing really look like? Cuz back in 2008, when the first Iron Man movie came out, I wanted to build Jarvis. And me and a friend of mine built what was then one of the world's first voice assistants. This is before Siri, before Alexa, to people just felt like magic. It grew to a few million users in the first few months. Then Google actually shut us down with a cease and desist. And while that company died, the thing that stayed with me was every time I saw somebody on their phone or their computer, it just felt so effortful and so mechanical and not how I want technology to feel like at all. For me, it's something that should just feel seamless. It just gets you. It's with you 24/7 and instead of drawing you into screens, it just lets you be a lot more present. And so today as we build whisper flow the key thing I think about and and this goes to some of the things you mentioned earlier as as well Tom is what I want is when I when I look at somebody's day spending 8 hours in their day I want to take every part of it that feels like grunt work and I want to make that experience better. I want to save time for people. I want to reduce that work off of their plate. Build AI that doesn't replace but augments humans. And so at the end, what you have is just more time for things that you really want to do, things that give you joy, things where you feel you're doing deep work. And the grunt work is what I want to replace. So to your your co-founder's point, Tom, if that's something he enjoys doing, he loves thinking while writing, I don't want to take that away. But for a lot of people, if you know what you want to say, you wake up in the morning, you have 50 emails in your inbox, you pretty much know what you want to respond to them. Why take two hours doing that when you can do it in 20 minutes with whisper? >> And that is where we see the largest amount of usage happen is people who are just burnt out and overwhelmed with the number of messages they have. Another group of people who love using it is a lot of developers and people who are starting to use AI tools a lot more to give themselves superpowers, do a lot more work faster to prompt them. Cuz again, the more context you give these tools, the better they work. And you just don't want to type all of that out. But when you're speaking, you just can go on a two-minute ramble, have a nice detailed prompt ready for you, just press enter, and it gets the work done for you. So hopefully that's helpful context setting and Tom happy to dive into whatever else of mind. >> Thanks so much and uh I like the ambitions behind this and well you're not alone in this world with making the life better and as so many productivity tools that we worked with in the past are promising too. The thing is really that the issue that we see over and over, it's really hard for them to understand what the people actually need and it gets worse the more people are using the tool because then everybody has an opinion. They think they might need this feature in the tool >> and then it becomes like the flag in the wind and and it becomes nothing. I'm not mentioning any tools out there but maybe some people can make a about this. But before we dive into this um I just want to mention I see a connection there with handwriting note-taking app evolution or revolution what you want to call it. So when I launched the channel in in 2018 I was talking a lot about handwriting note-taking apps and it's obvious why this became so popular. People love handwriting. Not everybody. Again, my co-founder never tries to handwrite. He always types, right? But so many people are better in thinking using a handwriting note-taking app or actually piece of paper and write something out. That's why we have tools like remarkable and things like that that people think they can use for their advantage. And back then it was easy to sell because telling people that people can now search through their handwriting and find information faster than going through the different paper notebooks. at the same time having it secured in the cloud this was revolutionary and the moment people understood this this became a real thing and Apple was the one who made it perfect again. So with whisper flow I see this the same way there was a lot of dictation things it it barely gets it right when you use the native uh dictation tools on the iPhone and so on. we got more and more this that it actually works to talk to the tool and we saw this with other tools like Tana and so on where now the new wave came of people loving to add the audio transcriptions to their note-taking apps but then we see something like Whisper Flow that makes it really independent from all the other tools and now the really the getting back to the original context here. How do you approach this? How far do you want to go with whisper flow when it comes to the feature set and being dependent focusing on text boxes or will you become a fullyfledged productivity hub or whatever? So that's really I'm interested in to learn more about and obviously the viewers too I'm guessing. >> Yeah. So there's a really simple way I look at this. So way we think about this is hey if there's 8 hours a day that you're spending on your phone and computer let's say I want as much of that to happen through whisper as possible. We start off with typing which actually the average person does five hours a day. It's a lot. And as we think about the next set of things to do when you use Whisper, it learns from you across how you're using it in every single application. And so it knows a lot more about you than a single application does. And with that, what we're able to do is to take Whisper from a tool where you speak and it writes for you to a tool where you speak and it does things for you and is finally able to help you proactively, which I think is what the best technologies are going to do cuz when some tool is able to do that, you really feel that it gets you. And so when we think about about what we prioritize there, right, I don't want to build an app which lets you book a flight because yes, it seems really cool. But people barely do that. What I would rather spend time building is, hey, what is a thing you do 20 times a day? How can I make your life better when you do that? Cuz it's likely not the best use of your time. And that is the thing that we would automate first and follow it up in that order. >> I love this approach. That's exactly what what uh I think over and over too. So or what I mentioned before, people think they may need this and then just because it's possible developers start developing it. But do I really want to have AI booking my flight? And the thing is we teach in the paperless movement in our coaching as well a lot. We get this a lot. We have a lot of business owners and CEOs and then we get these people saying I just hired a new personal assistant or I'm using now a motion for example that manages my calendar and lays out a task on the calendar and moves the due dates. And this is insane. This this makes really things worse. We see it over and over. people who are not productive in the first place become even less productive because they lose even more control where they haven't have enough control in the first place. So that's why we always compare it the digital world first to paper and to human. So if I >> cannot give a personal assistant just tell him hey book this flight and he books a flight first class you know the most expensive thing with six stops on the way there's no context that I gave to the personal assistant so how should it be able to make the best decision for me and if I define this for the personal assistant it will never work for the AI so I have to start with myself and get the workflows right and that's why using something like whisper flow it becomes really useful uh in this sense too that I can uh well it's in a personal space I I the what you just mentioned that you the the goal is not to automate your work but make it easier to work in the digital area this is really a good approach and I'm really happy to hear that but what are your thoughts about this you know human versus AI in this context >> it's a very good analogy Because that's how I think about whisper, right? And all AI tools in general, we have gotten to a point where as a person, you have the same expectations from an AI tool as you do with a person. You feel the same emotions towards an AI as you do with a person. When you give charge GPD something, it's like, hey, can you make this better? And it doesn't do a good job. You react the same way as you would with a very mediocre intern. Cuz that is the level of of quality of response that you're getting. And so what that means is what people are doing today when they're using an AI tool is they're actually hiring this AI tool as as though if they were hire a person to do a job for them. And when I think about that, that shows up in our product thinking in a couple of ways. Number one is what are the emotions that we're making the person feel and what is the mental model that we're building in this person's mind about the product. So take an example of of this thing. U say you ask an intern to draft something for you. This does a poor job but you give them feedback and the next time they get it right. We've all felt this before and then you feel so much more trust with that person even though they made a mistake. It doesn't matter. What matters is that when you coach them, they'll learn. And that is a big part that we had in flow from from day zero. When you fix a mistake, flow learns from it. And it tells you what it has learned. >> And this is actually I just have to interrupt here. This is something I noticed out of the box and I made it immediately better than alternatives in my opinion because I saw the note coming up. I updated this for the next time. I keep this in mind and this was already amazing and the next thing I was searching for is giving my own input for the words that I'm usually wrong pronouncing or anything like that and boom it was there and then I thought these guys are on the right track so yeah sorry but uh I can just >> I love to see your excitement on it because that is what we hoped we would get from users and at the end of the day you think about it's a it's a really simple notification right that is all it is but it makes the world of a difference if you start thinking about building your AI tools as you would expect a really smart intern to respond. The other big part that comes about it is about reliability. Can you fully delegate something to this person? If you can't and you have to doublech checkck their work all the time, this person's getting fired. What that looks like in the product sense is if your AI system is not able to do the thing that it does reliably, people are going to churn. people are going to stop using it or asking it to do anything ever again. Best example in case Siri promised it can do a thousand things. It can maybe do >> my theory just started when you said it. The thing is I have you know uh um dynamic dynamic lights and things like that. That's the only thing I control with Siri with very specific words. >> Yes. >> And uh this is it. everything else I rather don't ask because I just have to laugh otherwise >> because maybe Siri made a mistake once before >> and then initially you're like oh maybe I made a mistake and then it made a mistake again I was like you know what never mind this is the thing that is stupid >> I mean that's exactly it right automations are amazing as long they are working and this was already before the area era of AI that was exactly it if you have these Philips Hue lamps and all these things this is amazing But when you go into your living room and you cannot switch on the light because the Wi-Fi is down or whatever, this is the frustration that comes up now and that goes into exactly in your direction that you said with the reliability because that was the first thinking. How you know when I talk for 3 hours uh well let's three when I talk for 3 minutes into whisper how can I be sure that this is actually being recorded and that is something that's always a big worry and then I recognized oh it actually captures not only it it oh the thing is after these three minutes and you have selected the wrong box and it doesn't fill out the text box it's gone so therefore I looked into whisper and boom what is there you have a history of all the recordings that I can go through like a note takingaking app also it's not a note takingaking app for all everybody out there but I like that that is there I can reuse the things and that was amazing next checkbox so just already confirmed what you mentioned there when it comes to reliability well done >> the so the reliability is it not losing the thing but also getting the work done properly every single time when you look at a lot of the AI tools that are being built today they build the capability, hey, we can do this thing for you, but they can't do that thing really well where I can fully delegate the task over. And that I think is the biggest blocker that these tools see in adoption. And that's why when you use a new AI tool, you check out something and then you realize a month later that you never went back to it again. The biggest reason is because you didn't trust it. And so what that gets us to in in our decision and our our thinking essentially is if I ship five features in the next year, I want those to be one these five features to put should uh put a smile on people's faces. And two, they should build trust and work 100% reliable every single time. And I would rather do that than build 50 things that all seem really sexy, but work only half the time. Yeah, 100%. And I know big productivity companies, again not naming anyone, but they roll out huge AI features even for teams. And I worry a lot about any team member using the tools because it would mess up complete project management, business knowledge management, things like this. This is crazy. It's it's even dangerous because if you have planned out a lot of things and you give control without feedback loops and things like that, this is insane and as you said they over and over we see it's not reliable. It's it's we are still in the beginning and it's good that companies push so hard so we see more and more improvements in the area and the competition ensures that things eventually get right. But we always appreciate companies like here whisperflow but Hepabase is another example that really have a vision behind this and follow up exactly this the strategy behind this the framework they built and bring solutions to exact the problem that we're thinking about and not about hey here I have an API connection to open AAI tell me what I need to build right and and then you get something random this that's really a good approach there. I wonder and actually I wondered about the iOS integration of whisper flow. I don't know about Android as I'm only on iOS but this is very well executed as I also keep in mind all the obstacles you must have gone through to implement it this way. So maybe you can share a bit more with all the restrictions on Apple to make it possible that I can use whisper flow in my in my keyboard and maybe you can also share um some insights about privacy and things like that if people are worried about this. >> Of course and I can actually show a quick demo of how this works. So what we have is this keyboard on iOS where you can just press this button and you can speak and you oh tap it again and then text shows up perfectly formatted wherever you are. >> And the best thing about this is it works in every single application and it's the same keyboard. When you're also using it on the desktop version, it learns about people you care about, your writing style and so on. So that is shared on mobile as well. And the biggest thing it does is, for example, I have a 10-minute walk to the office. By the time I'm here, for the first time in my life, I'm actually sending emails on my phone. I hate writing emails on my phone, but by the time I get to the office, my inbox is clear. And it is fantastic. And there were so many people I would just procrastinate sending messages to cuz I was like, I got to like just write this whole thing down. But now with Whisper, I just speak it, it writes it in my tone, and then I can just press send. And here we have to the other thing between dictation tools and the new AI way is the corrections. So if I rumble, if I make um elms, the filler words and all this gaps, it cuts it out. And if I say if I said something wrong, it just picks the best version and things like that. So I really don't have all this editing stuff up front uh afterwards after I recorded it with whisflow. So, that's really a big advantage for sure. >> Yep. 100%. And one of my favorite features about the mobile app is actually the fact that I can whisper. And so, uh, we'll see if the Okay, I'm going to pull the mic right up close to my mouth and then we're going to do a live demo of this. >> Not even hurt anything on the >> No, but there we go. >> There you go. >> There we go. >> Perfectly put it down. >> Yeah. Perfect. And this is actually something I had on mind since the beginning. Now I'm envisioning all these people in an open office. Instead of hearing the typing sound from the keyboard, now you hear everybody whispering. So I don't know if this is really a paradigm shift here. >> Yep. No, it is it is starting to happen. Like in our office, every single person has a mic that just comes up to here and they're all just silently speaking to their computers cuz you can speak so quietly. The person beside you doesn't hear a thing. And I have to admit, it comes naturally to some people more than others. I would say 60% of the people in the office started using it day zero. I was the last person to start using it. Took me a year to build the habit of actually being comfortable speaking around people. But the first couple of times you do it now, it's just it's just there. And there are some companies where we go and do a nice white glove whisper on boarding. And for them, we actually take the mics and we just set their team up with it and we're like, just give it a shot. And just one day later, you see half the company using Whisper for everything that they're doing. And it's insane how workplaces are starting to evolve. >> Yeah, that's true. I mean in the end of the day if they talk to a coworker it is really a similar situation. It's just a different perspective that people have and well it was not usual that people type on plastic keys and that was became a common thing and as soon becomes useful it will find its way. But now this being said you say they do everything with with whisper flow. Do you really think >> that there will be an boys controlled OS at any point in time as we see now China is something launching there as well uh where they say it's possible. So what are your thoughts on this? You know, a lot of people when they when they think about a voice controlled OS, what they think about is like everything's happening with voice, right? But that is actually a really poor UX because voice is great for a number of things, but not everything. Do I want to say open iMessage every single time I go to text somebody? Like, no. Clicking is just so much faster. Imagine if I'm taking a picture and I just say photo photo every time I want to click a picture. That is also just sounds so dumb. No, you just click a button. And so what I think will happen is we are going to start seeing voice first operating systems where everything can happen with voice but there are still for some things you need just point and click cuz it's so much faster. >> And so that however will become secondary and I don't think we're too far away from it. There's parts of it that we've been prototyping in house at Whisper and actually scaling the team up significantly to build this out and it is going to be one of the most magical experiences that people will will be able to see in the next couple of years. We that is by the way how Flow came out to be. Whisper was actually a hardware company and we built Flow as the operating system that ran on that hardware. And so the voice dictation part that we have exposed out as a product right now was one of the many features that we had built into it. And so we started off building the operating system and I think if we are really on a goal to transform what the layer between people and technology and have whisper be there uh this is the end goal that we're building towards and in no way is it easy to build it but I think we have the right set of principles in place within the company and the core team that makes me confident that I think we can get there. >> That sounds ambitious and well I love their approach again and and how you frame the things. Uh I also think AR could really benefit from such an OS because in the end there we have now the issue with using a mouse and keyboard and things like that. So the better I can control AR AR devices, the better our AR glass um VR glasses and things like that. So this is really exciting to see. The thing is I agree. I mean when I when it comes to design and all these things, if I need to describe everything in detail, then it's sometimes faster to be the expert and use the tool. And getting a mix of it is certainly the right way to go for sure. Mhm. >> So you said using voice not just to write faster but to think faster. >> Do I think faster because I no longer need to write? And then obviously this only applies to people who write slower than they talk, right? >> Yes. >> So what how this how does this come up? >> So the way this comes up is is really if you think about people, right? The average person types at 40 words per minute. They speak at 250 words per minute. If they're really going at it, they can go like 350 400 and but people think at about 350 400 words per minute. So when you're typing, you actually lose so much context of what's actually going on in your head. And just giving people the ability to speak opens those floodgates. So, what we've heard from people who are more just verbal thinkers is they're able to put so much more of their thoughts and context down on paper cuz the a lot of times getting through that brain frog, getting through that writer's block, like even if you might be writing like a project report for a company, right, there's still a writer's block associated there cuz you have so much context in your head and you're just worrying about, hey, how do I structure it? One of the ways I found Whisper really help people and how they describe it is Whisper takes care of just the first draft of structuring it. So you only need to focus on the ideas. And if you're not spending time thinking about where every comma and full stop comes and how different words are spelled if you're not a native English speaker, just imagine the amount of just cognitive load that it takes off of your shoulders and just puts it down back into that creative part of your mind. And that is I think what the biggest impact is. A lot of people say how it saves time. Some person compared it that it makes responding to emails 60% faster. He actually timed himself like responding to 50 emails like like side by side. And the biggest impact though that I feel is just this cognitive load that gets lifted off because it makes all of this work effortless. The work that people just don't look forward to doing at all. that in some ways is the the biggest impact that people feel and that's the one that gives them joy because it's just this constant feeling of dopamine hits every time you're you're uh saving this effort. I mean it's true that uh I'm a typical persona for this where I think while I'm talking so I'm if I have brainstorming sessions things like that so I rather want to start rambling and then extract the essence out of this in order to get what well the conclusions on the other hand you know I think you cannot directly compare typing with talking if we talk about thinking right so again thinking about my cell phone or myself. If I take notes, meeting notes or some things that go around in my head, I make bullet points and I make just the core words. I don't set commas, you know, things like that. That's something I can let AI do afterwards and, you know, fill the the gaps again. So, that's where I agree with you. When I fill out emails, when I send an answer that I think is like this, that really speeds it up. But when it comes to thinking, if I really speak everything out and then I say I'm faster this way, I think it's only faster if I process it if I process it afterwards. So I I have really the condensed information out of what I talked about. >> Yeah. No, I agree 100%. So like it breaks out that mental model for like first put your thoughts down then put it in a structure versus thought structure thought structure thought structure thought structure. >> Exactly. And that's why I mentioned that whisper is never a note takingaking app. We call it movement or in the icon methodology utility application. So people mix this up. Notebook LM I just published a video about it. Same thing. People think it is my personal knowledge management system and noting. No, it's not. It's just a intermediate tool that I use to for problem solving. But then I need to have a central point to have the knowledge either it is in the business knowledge system or in my personal knowledge management system. And that's why again whisper flow even that I have all this rambling if I never extract the things that I got out there or I completed the task writing the email things like that it's not used for that and educating people to really understand what these tools are used for I think will also reduce the disappointment and reduce the number of people reach disappointment about something that they expected that's not there and people reaching out asking for features which this tool was never built for. Right. Mhm. >> In no sense, this is any degradation of whisper. It is just amazing. We love these focused tools. And I'm curious about when you said there is a lot more in the back end, what's coming too? Because, you know, if you get a solid foundation like this, you can go wild for sure. I'm curious if there is any next big thing that you could share with us that you're planning for whisper flow or for flow. Feel free or nothing else. >> Yeah. Uh, you know what? I want to keep that as a surprise. What I would say though is it's up on desktop, both Mac and Windows. >> Mhm. >> And iPhone, and we're going to have a big Android launch in a few months time. So, for people who who get on and start using it, you're going to be the first people to get all the new and exciting features that we ship. >> That's great. That's exactly what we want to hear. So, Tanai, I thank you so much for this interview. I have a feeling it wasn't the last one after we see the new big launches. And I can't wait to >> No, I'm excited to keep doing this, man. >> Absolutely. And uh we catch up afterwards. And for those who don't know what Whisper Flow is, go into the description below or check out the video that I made about Whisper Flow already to see actually I have 80 words per minute when I'm typing and I also got over 200 when I started using Whisper Flow. So, highly recommend it. Thanks so much for being with us and I catch you next time. >> Take care."

        "srt": "Ever wish you could ditch typing and just talk your way through emails, notes, or even code? Today, we're comparing two heavy hitters in voice dictation: Whisper Flow and Super Whisper. By the end of this, you'll know which one's worth your time and your voice. First up, Whisper Flow. This is for anyone who wants seamless AI powered dictation across every app. Whether you're drafting emails in Gmail, coding in VS Code, or slacking off on Slack, it's crazy fast, claiming to be four times quicker than typing, and it's packed with smart features like autoedits, tone matching, and support for 100 plus languages. Needed to learn your quirky vocab. It's got a personal dictionary for that. Pricing starts free with a 2,000word weekly limit, or go pro for $15 a month for unlimited words and advanced editing commands. The trade-off, some users report occasional hiccups with system integration, and the free tier might feel tight for power users. Now, Super Whisper. This one's a beast for privacy conscious folks. It works offline, keeps everything on your device, and still nails transcription with perfect punctuation. Perfect for walks, noisy cafes, or just avoiding the cloud. It's also versatile, letting you whisper notes and then spit them out as polished emails or docs. The free version covers basics, but the pro plan unlocks cloud models and translation for $8.49 per month. Downsides, the mobile app isn't as slick as Whispers yet, and longer dictations might need a pause button. So, who wins? If you need deep app integration, AI smarts, and team features, Whisper Flows your pick. But if offline privacy and simplicity matter more, Super Whisper's the move. Either way, your keyboard's about to get a very long"

        "srt": "Over the last year, I've gotten really jazzed about how I work and the different tools I use, and I want to make this quick video to share it. So, first off, I'm going to share Raycast. This is a tool I used in place of Spotlight. It gives you access to all the apps you use, but there's a ton more you can do with different Raycast extensions. It's a beautifully designed app. Takes some time to get used to, get some time to get warmed up, but once you're in it, it really changes your workflow. Another tool that I use a lot is Whisper Flow, and I use that to dictate to my computer. It lives down here at the bottom of your screen and it makes it really easy to dictate. I'm going to share a couple examples about how I use these tools and hopefully it's helpful. So, first up, the easiest way to get started with Raycast is the clipboard history. Feel like that was one of the reasons I initially installed it a couple years ago. It's a keyboard shortcut and basically instead of hitting command paste, I hit command shiftV and it pulls up all of the things in my clipboard history. I can also search through these and see anytime I mention a specific word. And this makes it really easy. And when you want to paste something, you can just put it in inside any text box. The other reason I use Raycast a ton is for snippets. Snippets are basically what you'd think of as text expander. You can either replace text. So in my instance, if I do two dashes, it always turns it into an M dash. Or if I start writing a couple letters, it'll paste in my address or my phone number, things like that. But what I find easiest and what I love about Raycast is all through search. So, I actually don't really need to remember too many shortcuts. I just need to remember the raycast shortcut and a couple other ones that I use really frequently. So, for me, my snippets is command pulls up my snippets. And again, you can search through these to paste in anything. So, for example, here I've got the reflection app hex code. I use that a whole bunch. I'm always sharing the link for reflection app. So, I got the download link in here and that makes it really easy. So, I just type in download, hit enter. And the other tool I use a lot is voice I mentioned. So, whisper flow. It works really well in tandem with raycast. Let me give you an example of that. You don't need to open anything with whisper. The way I initiate it is I just hold down the function key. So let's think of a good example here. I'm going to open up a sauna. This is the task manager I use. Here's a feature request we recently got in for reflection app. I'll dictate to this by holding down the function key. I think it's a great idea. And instead of it living in the entry, maybe can live as a guide. Instead of generating a prompt, maybe we can generate a guide for the user based on what they're experiencing and feeling in that moment. I release the function key and it pastes in the text. Now, Apple has a native text to speech option, but this is so much better because it uses AI to clean up the text and it uses the context around it. And if I go in, let's say I set a name here. I didn't in this example, let's say I said someone's name and I went in and I edited how that name was typed. Whisper flow will remember that and go in and save that to its memory. So, little small things like that is what I love about it. It's really out of sight, out of mind, but it's just really thoughtful in how it's designed. Now, a lot of times I'll ramble. So, this is where raycast and whisper flow work really well together. I'll highlight this text and I've got a quick action where I do command shift period and my quick action grabs any text that's highlighted and it makes it clean and concise. I just hit enter and it replaces my text. I've got a kind of couple things I wanted to share in this video. So, let's see. Okay, another cool thing about Raycast and this is a really simple one but again another good way to get started. Our team is fully remote. We've got people on the east coast in the US, people in Europe. So I want to say 400 p.m. in Amsterdam in New York City and then it'll give me the time in the different time zone. So that makes it really nice. The other thing that Raycast recently added is AI deeply integrated into everything. So while I can type in anything to search here like apps or playing a next song or really any way to manage my computer, I can also just type in a question here. Give me a good journaling prompt to start my day. and I hit tab and it's going to ask AI through the integration here and you can ask a follow-up question. You can also open up the response in the AI chat. Raycast has a dedicated AI chat. I'm going to share that in a little bit. Another cool thing is window management. So in this example, let's say I want to have this on the left and I want to have this on the right. You can do some quick stuff that's really easy. And another cool thing, let's say you have a YouTube video you're watching and you want to get a little bit more out of it. I'm going to pause this quick and I can just say summarize YouTube video. A lot of these extensions are native to Raycast, but there's also a third party extension. So there's really a pretty big library and this just summarizes the video. It can happen while you're watching, but you can have that up so you can read it while you're in there and you can also ask follow-up questions from it. And another example, here's a blog post we recently wrote about how we've integrated a lot of the latest from Google into reflection app. Now I want to ask a question here. Is Vertex AI for Firebase a secure tool? For example, and then it talks about how in the article we mentioned how we use Firebase app check and a couple different tools alongside it. Okay, let's get a little bit deeper into a raycast. Raycast and I has a keyboard shortcut and it brings up this window. And in here I've got these past conversations. So it looks like a standard tool you'd use like chat GPT or cloud. What's cool about raycast and why I decided to go for it personally and why I replaced using chatgbt and cloud on my computer is because I can really easily switch models. For me that was really cool. So I have access to the latest from cloud. I have the access latest from Google and the latest from Chat GPT, but I only have to pay one subscription. So, that's handy. And I often switch them. I feel like sometimes the responses are better from Gemini. For textbased things, I really like Claude. For reasoning, I really like OpenAI. So, I swap between them. And I have all these different presets here. So, I've got a task manager, a UI expert, someone helps me with my investor updates, business coaches. I've got different models that I use. And those are called presets. And each of the presets have different settings. So I have system instructions and you can add in different AI extensions. I'll talk a little bit more about that later. I did create a UIUX expert and I like to share screenshots with it sometimes when I'm really stuck on something. So it's not perfect, but it gives me an alternative perspective to think about something. So I've got these two different designs I was thinking about. This is part of the onboarding screen, and it gives you personalized prompts for your first journal entry. And I created two different options, option A and option B. And let's say I didn't know which one to go with. So I'm going to hit command shift 2. This takes a screenshot and puts it in any open raycast window I already have. And now I'm going to ask it a question. I've got option A on the left, option B on the right. Which one do you think is a better onboarding experience for the user? All right. So option A versus option B. Quick take. Option A is a clear winner. and it goes through all the different reasons why I've got it set up like this where it gives me the quick take what works fix this priority actions and then the build kill decision that's built into my prompt here the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to share a sneak peek of something that we just started exploring I have to thank a developer at Reflection Brian who helped me with this last night but I really wanted to get my Asana into Raycast Raycast has MCP support and MCPs are like AI agents speaking with and AI agents. And so I wanted to engage with Asana instead of just pasting in some of my recent to-dos into here. Here is a chat I have where I'm using Raycast own LLM as an option and it interacts with my Asana. I've got Asauna here as an MCP. I also have Google Calendar, but we're not going to go too deep into that today. Basically, I can create a task and manage my Asana tasks through here. Create a task in reflection marketing project that says create a video about raycast mcps and how I use it with asana. Assign it to me and have it due today. It confirms the information and then gives me the oper option to approve it. And here's the task. It just popped up here. break this task down into smaller pieces. So everything I would need to create a video and then add them all as subtasks. So it decided on itself. Research content, write script, record video, edit video and it suggest them all as subtasks and I can confirm all. Here are the subtasks being created for me in a sauna and assign all the subtasks to me and set due dates each one day after the other starting with today. 19th, 20th. Cool. Pretty insane. Basically, I can interact with my ASA and I can set tasks as complete, move them around. That's all through the MCP that we have built in here. Okay, that's it for Raycast. I know it's a lot of information. I was hoping to make a two-minute video or maybe 10-minute video. This is a little bit about how I use some of these tools. Hopefully, it was helpful. And yeah, if you'd like to see more of these or specific questions, just let me know. Thanks."

        "srt": "Ever feel like your thoughts flow faster than your fingers can type? Yeah, that's because they actually do. We speak almost three times faster than we type. Which means every time you're stuck hammering on a keyboard, your ideas are already miles ahead. So, what do you do? You go to voice to text tools like Whisper Flow. They let you speak naturally and turn your words into text instantly. While whisper flow makes the process beautifully simple, it does have a lot of hiccups with background noise, editing control, and device compatibility. So, if you love Whisper Flow but wish it did just a little more, here are five powerful alternatives that take voice to text to the next level. [Music] So, let's start with the first one, ClickUp. ClickUp is the world's first converged AI workspace built to end work in AI sprawl. With its talkto text feature, you can capture ideas up to four times faster than typing in over 40 languages. And because it's powered by contextaware AI, it recognizes your teammates names, your projects, and even document titles as you speak. Then there's Brainax, your desktop AI super app that keeps your entire workspace connected. It can search through every note, doc, or task within your ClickUp workspace and connected apps to pull answers to get work done in seconds. ClickUp makes sure you never lose your best ideas to context switching and tab hopping. It's the one intelligent workspace that brings everything together. Moving on to our next tool, Otter AI. Otter listens to your conversations in real time and types them out verbatim for you. No matter what meeting you're taking or when you need the summary, Otter can figure things out for you. But remember, Otter sometimes needs a tuneup. If there's a lot of background noise or people talking over each other, you may not get the best results. Still, for fast and easy note-taking, Otter is a real lifesaver. Now, if Otter is your meeting sidekick, then Sony's AI is the language wizard, just one that lives in your pocket. Sonox is great if you've got teammates from different countries or you need your notes in more than one language. You just drop in your audio or video, and Sonics turns it to text in over 40 languages with no problem. You can polish your transcript, highlight the important stuff, and share it with others. But here's the catch. If you're using it a lot, you'll probably need to pay for extra transcriptions once the free trial runs out. The fourth tool on our list is Mac Whisper. This one is just for Mac users. What's cool about Mac Whisper is that it works even if you don't have internet access. Since everything is stored locally on your computer, your notes are also private and safe. Just record your voice and Mac Whisper turns it into text. No cloud dependency. No worries. The only thing is if you're not a Mac user, you're out of luck. Mac Whisper doesn't work on Windows or mobile devices. Last but not least, we have dictote. Dictote is kind of like talking to yourself. You can speak freely and it writes down what you say. You can even use voice in it. It's speechto text extension on the Chrome web store. This reduces the need for fast internet and helps keep your voice data more private. Dictote works best on Google Chrome. So, if you're using a different browser or want to use it on your phone, it might not be the perfect fit for you. And that wraps up our list. Five awesome alternatives to Whisper. Whether you want something for your team, need notes in different languages, or just want to keep things private, there's a tool here for you. Try them out and see which one makes your life easier. And hey, if you want accurate transcription that feeds into your work, plus a little AI magic, check out ClickUp at the link in the description."

        "srt": "Welcome back to the deep dive. Today, uh, we're jumping into what feels like the ultimate AI voice dictation battle for 2025. >> Yeah, it's a hot space. >> We're looking closely at three big names. >> Auto.AI, Whisper Flow, and Super Whisper. >> And what's really um fascinating here is how the markets kind of split. You've got two main paths emerging. >> Oh, cool. >> Well, on one side, there's the, let's call it the comprehensive AI meeting agent. It's all about managing collaboration, teams, that sort of thing. >> Okay. The meeting focus, >> right? And then the other side is more like pure dictation, super seamless, focused just on getting your thoughts down lightning fast. Solo work mostly. >> Got it. So, our mission today is basically to cut through the noise, figure out the real strategic value of each one, help you decide which tool fits your specific way of working. >> Exactly. Whether that's mostly meetings or maybe rapid writing or perhaps if security is your absolute top priority. >> Okay, let's dig in then. We probably have to start with otter.ai, right? They seem to have really cornered that collaboration market. They're making some big claims about saving time. Users saving over four hours a week. How are they actually doing that? It's got to be more than just a transcript. Yeah. >> Oh, absolutely. The live transcript, which you know, they say gets up to 95% accuracy. That's just the baseline, right? >> The real power comes from the automation and um the integration side of things. Otter is designed to almost be like an executive assistant for your meetings, right? So you sync it with say Jira, your project management tool. It automatically pulls out action items and can even create tickets. >> Ah, clever. >> Or if you use something like Greenhouse for recruiting, Otter syncs your interview notes straight in. It automates that whole tedious process of updating records >> and those specialized agents they have >> for sales, recruiting, media. That sounds like it really locks in value if you're constantly working with specific third party tools. >> Precisely. If deep integration and team collaboration are your world, Otter is built for that. It even has that hey Otter voice query thing now. >> Okay, so Otter integration and team efficiency. But what if, like you said, my work is less about meetings and more about just getting my own ideas down, individual creation. >> Perfect transition. That brings us squarely into the territory of whisper flow. This is where the conversation shifts heavily towards speed and uh personal output, >> right? The speed claims are huge here. They say it's 4x faster than typing. Something like 220 words per minute. >> Yeah, that's the big number they push. Comparing it to average typing around 45 words per minute. It's a dramatic difference. >> But, you know, just dictating super fast often means you end up with a rambling mess of text, lots of ums, filler words. How does Whisper Flow make sure that 220 words per minute is actually useful? That's their key differentiator. I think they call it AI autoedits. >> AI autoedits. >> Yeah. The system is designed to instantly process your spoken words, filter out all the ums and a's, the pauses, the filler, and format it into clean, well ststructured text, almost in real time. >> So, it's not just transcribing, it's actively cleaning it up as you go. >> Exactly. It's like drafting and polishing simultaneously. They argue it cuts down on that huge mental effort of constantly self-correcting that you normally do with dictation. Plus, it has things like a personal dictionary and snippets for voice shortcuts. >> Interesting. So, Whisper Flow is aiming for speed, polished output, and it works across Mac, Windows, iPhone. Okay, that brings us to number three, Super Whisper. >> It also talks about speed, maybe 3x faster writing, but its main hook seems to be privacy. Mhm. >> What does offline first actually mean for the user? >> It means fundamentally that all the transcription, all the processing happens right there on your device, your Mac or your iPhone. It doesn't need Wi-Fi to work, right? >> And critically, their big claim is private and secure. The idea is your sensitive data, your voice, your text, it never leaves your computer. It's not going to a third party cloud server somewhere. >> Okay. But does processing everything locally mean you sacrifice something like maybe the deep integrations Otter has or maybe even some cutting edge accuracy that comes from cloud-based AI. Is that privacy worth potential trade-off? >> Well, for some people it's not really a trade-off. It's a requirement. Think legal, healthcare, anyone in a highly regulated field. >> Ah, good point. Mandatory privacy. >> Exactly. Okay, so Super Whisper gives you that peace of mind and it still offers features like support for over a 100 languages, plus you can add custom vocabulary for technical terms. >> Okay, so let's try and wrap this up. It sounds like three pretty distinct niches here. >> Definitely. >> You've got Otter.AI, the really sophisticated AI meeting agent built for team workflows, heavy integration, >> the collaborator. >> Then whisperflow, the seamless writer, all about raw speed, getting polished first drafts down quickly across different apps. the creators tool, speed and polish. >> And finally, Super Whisper, the private dictator, focused on local processing, offline security, and maybe strong language support, >> the secure option, offline and versatile. >> So for you listening, it really boils down to your priorities. >> Absolutely. If those third party integrations and saving time across your whole team are the main goals, Otter seems like the obvious pick. But if what you need is sheer speed for creating your own polished text or if data privacy and working offline are absolutely critical, then whisperflow or super whisper offer really strong uh specific advantages, >> right? Which leads to a final thought. We heard Otter users report saving over 4 hours a week, mostly through automating meeting tasks. So how should you value that 4x faster than typing claim from whisper flow in your day? >> Yeah, it's an interesting calculation. Is it about time saved for the team via integration >> or pure output gained for you, the individual creator?"

        "srt": "Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're jumping into AI audio transcription tools. It's uh it's more than just speed now, isn't it? >> Oh, absolutely. Speed's almost a given. We're talking accuracy. Often hitting over 95% super fast processing. AI is definitely replacing manual work fast, >> right? So, what we want to do today is compare these tools, but maybe look past just the speed things like, you know, data privacy, how well they handle different languages, and what they're actually best for. >> Exactly. Is it for dictation or maybe transcribing big meetings? Because that choice you make, it could be about convenience. Sure. But it might also impact your data security without you realizing it. >> Okay, let's start there then. The security part that seems critical, especially if you're handling sensitive stuff, medical files maybe, or confidential research interviews. >> That's the highest priority for many users. And it comes down to this core divide, how the tool is built. Is it local or cloud? >> Local versus cloud. Explain that difference. >> Sure. So local or ondevice tools, think of things like the open- source model whisper or uh Super Whisper, which is Mac only. They do all the processing right there on your machine, >> meaning the audio file itself never goes anywhere. >> Precisely. It never leaves your device. So for confidentiality, that's inherently the safer path. No third party servers involved. >> But I guess the immediate question is, do you lose something by keeping it local? maybe fewer features or is it slower than the big cloud platforms? >> That can be the perception. Yeah, sometimes there's a tradeoff. But if security is paramount, it might be a trade-off you have to make. >> Okay. So, what about the other side, the cloud tools, >> right? So, platforms like Otter.ai or TR, maybe Rev, they work differently. Your audio gets uploaded and processed on their remote servers. Often that's Amazon Web Services, AWS, or maybe Microsoft Azure. And that immediately rings alarm bells for things like GDPR or hypo compliance. >> It definitely can. You're introducing another party that handles your data. And there's sort of a hidden aspect, too. >> What's that? >> Well, many of these cloud services, um, Otter.AI and Rev included, their default setting is often to use your d your audio, your transcripts to actually train their own AI models. >> Wow. So, your confidential conversations could be feeding their algorithm >> potentially. Yes. Now sometimes you can opt out but you need to actively look for that setting for journalists, lawyers, anyone dealing with sensitive sources. That's a huge consideration. >> Okay, so architecture clearly defines the security level. Let's pivot to workflow. How you actually use these tools day-to-day, >> right? Because a tool might be secure but completely wrong for your needs. >> Makes sense. >> Let's talk about meetings first. Otter.ai seems to own that space, doesn't it? >> It really does. It's built for collaboration. integrates slickly with Zoom, with Teams. It can even, you know, track who attended automatically. Really shines in that group setting. >> Yeah, there must be downsides. >> Yeah, the main ones are needing constant internet access. It is cloud-based after all. And the free version is well, pretty tight. You only get 30 minutes per recording and just 300 minutes total per month. >> Okay. So, what's the alternative? If you're not primarily recording meetings, maybe just dictating notes or emails, >> then you look at tools more focused on personal productivity, uh things like Super Whisper again or maybe Willow Voice. They're designed for quick voice to text across lots of different apps on your computer, >> like the Old Dragon Naturally Speaking software, but uh hopefully better. >> Well, yes and no. They're generally much faster and more accurate for straight transcription. But here's a common frustration people have actually coming from that Dragon legacy. >> What's that? >> Those older tools were really good at voice commands. You could say new paragraph or open parenthesis and it would do it. These newer AI tools, they often just transcribe those words literally. >> Ah, so they hear new paragraph and just type out new paragraph. >> Exactly. It can be quite frustrating if you're used to dictating formatting and structure that way. They're more about pure transcription speed. >> Interesting distinction. Okay, let's talk raw performance and accuracy. There's been research on this, right? >> Yes, quite a bit. A recent study, I think it was out of Germany's Institute of Media Research did a head-to-head. They found Whisper, the underlying model for many tools, performed quote, best overall. >> Best overall based on what? >> Across several criteria. For instance, in German language interviews, it hit a word accuracy measure above 70%. Which is pretty solid for complex multi-speaker audio. And who was at the other end of the scale in that study? >> That was actually Dragon. The study found it was the least reliable for transcribing those kinds of multis-speaker interviews. Its accuracy in the German test, it dropped below 5%. >> Wow. Below 5% that's a basically unusable for interview. >> It really underlines that Dragon was built for a single trained voice giving commands, not for separating different speakers in a messy realworld conversation. >> But even the best tools aren't perfect. Yeah. >> You mentioned Whisper being top overall, but there's this risk of what what did you call it? Hallucination. >> Exactly. Hallucination. It's a known issue with large language models which power these tools. Even Whisper, despite its high accuracy, isn't immune. >> What does that mean in practice? >> Well, in high stakes areas like healthcare documentation, studies have shown Whisper can sometimes just invent things, non-existent facts, maybe treatments that weren't discussed, even policies that don't exist. >> How often does that happen? One study found it occurred in about 1.4% of medical transcriptions using whisper. Now 1.4% sounds small, but in a medical or legal context, inventing information like that carries massive risks, huge liability. >> Okay, so pulling this all together, the main message seems to be there's no single best app. It's about matching your specific need, privacy, speed, collaboration to the tools fundamental design, its architecture. >> Precisely. And if confidentiality is your absolute top priority, especially dealing with sensitive research or personal data, then local ondevice processing is technically always going to be the safest bet, even if it means sacrificing a few bells and whistles. >> So, we know now really that every automated transcript needs a human review. A human in the loop is essential. >> Absolutely critical. >> But thinking about that 1.4% hallucination rate in medicine, it makes you wonder, doesn't it? Knowing these powerful AI tools can actively invent information, how many less obvious errors, maybe non-existent facts or subtly wrong details, might be hiding in the transcripts you rely on right"

I got brought in by a friend, met his close friends in different startups and businesses they were starting and made some really amazing connections. And that's what we're also trying to do is break the barriers to communication at Whisper Flow. And that's why we think we're the perfect sponsor. So, we've all tried the text to speech apps, whether that's in Siri or on your Mac, and they're absolutely awful. So, we've tked to change that using the latest AI models. What you say exactly turns into perfect pace to text in every single application that you're working with. I use Whisper Flow every day, all day. Whether that's texting my fiance, responding to an email to an investor, or responding to the massive torrent of Slack messages that come in. I probably spend about 3 to four times less responding to messages and actually thinking and strategizing. I talk at around 150 words per minute, so that ends up being my typing speed. Uh, and that was absolutely life-changing to me where I could do so much more work without wasting time. Did I spell that right? Does it sound right? I I'm always comfortable kind of saying my thoughts and that's probably the the best way it's supposed to be written instead of trying to translate it into written text. Whisper Flow is free for everyone to use on whisperflow.ai. You can download it on iOS, Mac, and Windows. Just go through a quick onboarding, say what you want to type, and it goes pasted into that application instantaneously. So, I've alluded to a lot of the changes that we've been doing to break the barriers to communication, but really towards messages. We're trying to break and become the new way that you interface with technology as a whole. So, you guys will be able to see how you can use voice to interact with your phone or your computer. My name is Matt. I'm the head of growth at Whisper Flow and I can't wait to see you guys at Summerjam."

So, I'll just do one as a as as I normally talk. Hi, Fred. Today I'm talking about Whisper Flow. This is a new AI app. I use it all the time and it does various things. Um, and now, uh, [ __ ] what am I talking about? Oh, yes, I know. The various things it does is one, it increases your speed, your typing speed by about four times. Two, it rewrites your text for you in reasonably clear language. Well, doesn't rewrite it, just types it up, uh, tidies it up. And three, you can then ask it to change the format whilst you're still in the program that you're working on. You can see there quite amazingly it got rid of all of my arms and Rs. The only thing I would put in there is I would actually make a new line there and it's put it into dot point. So it's it's made my garble text into something that's really quite realistic. Now the other thing you can do is if you if I want to highlight that and say I don't want it in dot points I want it in more informal style. I can hit another set of keys which puts it in command mode and then I can ask it to rewrite this. I'm going to do that now. Please rewrite this. Uh don't put it in dot format. put it in conversational style. It has to think for a little bit to do this, but it's rewritten that for me. And now I'm going to rewrite it again and say I want a new line for each sentence. So I'll hold down my keys. Please reformat this with a new line for each sentence. There you have it. Now, it has a whole lot of other features, but that's are the main ones that I really like. I can't recommend this highly enough."

        "srt": "Hey guys, my name is Robert. Recently I have noticed that dictation tools are becoming more and more popular with the rise of AI applications. People are realizing that talking to your computer instead of typing can save a lot of time. In this video I want to explain to you what this is all about, especially with AI involved. It's a big topic, but here I will just give you an overview of some applications that I have tried, their pros and cons, and I also want to show you how to do this for free, locally, and without the internet. Now, dictation itself isn't something new. Computers and phones have had this feature for a long time, and there's always been specialized software for this as well. But with Whisper AI, a model trained in multiple languages and amazing accuracy, the possibilities have expanded a lot. While Whisper and similar models are not perfect, when combined with LLMs, the time-saving potential and everything that you can do is kind of mind-blowing. Let me break this down in a more simple way. There are two main parts to this new AI dictation that we're starting to see around. First, there's transcription. That's where the speech-to-text AI model turns your voice into text. The second part involves running that text through a large language model, or LLM for short. This is where a lot of the cool stuff happens. LLMs, like Chagipity, can improve grammar, format text, translate, summarize, restructure. It can answer questions, help with coding, explain complex topics, and so much more. It really is like having a super smart assistant with you. By combining highly accurate transcription with these powerful language models, we are opening up a whole new world of possibilities. It's an impressive integration of voice and text technologies. There's a lot more to this, especially since new speech-to-speech models are starting to appear, but that's a topic for another time. Okay, let's look at how this works in practice. I'll cover some popular apps that use dictation that can be run through language models. I'll try to cover user experience, features, limitations, pricing, and some thoughts on privacy and workflow integration. First up is Mac Whisper. This app has been around since early Whisper AI models started to appear online, and it is great for audio transcription. It can process audio files, create subtitles from YouTube links, and has many advanced settings that I haven't found anywhere else. Notice here that I am talking transcription. which is taking an audio file and transforming it into text. Only recently has MacWhisper added dictation, which can also be processed with large language models for more accurate grammar, translation, and other tasks. Okay, so I'm here on MacWhisper, and as you can see, we have many different options, and dictation is only one of them. One of the cool things about MacWhisper is that it allows you to use local models for transcription. I even think this maybe was the main function of the app to allow you to interact with these models. And as you can see, there's so many to the point that it actually gets a little bit confusing. You have to click this button to see the differences. The accuracy and speed, of course, depend on factors like model size, model training, whether you are using cloud models or your system specifications. For this example, I will just be using OpenAI Cloud. and it's really cool that they also allow you to use this. Let me go inside the dictation area. Here you can set, well, on the top we have a video showing you a little bit how this works. Then we can set up our own custom keyboard shortcut to start dictating. And here we have an area where you can select a prompt. I will start with nothing, but the AI service that I will choose will be GPT-40 mini. This one is not the smartest model, but it's pretty fast. You can choose between many different services here. You can choose even local models, and that's a very nice recent addition. Let me go back in dictation. And down here, you can make your own different prompts if you want the transcription to be processed like I was explaining to you a moment ago. I will start with nothing. And here, for example, cleanup. This one will just have fixed grammar mistakes, spelling, stuff like that. This one will translate. And this one is just AI assistant. I will show you how that works in one moment. This one only says this. Now let me just start dictating so you can see how it looks in action. And I am dictating. I'm speaking to my microphone and this should be transcribed. And I press the shortcut again. And there it is. And actually, even though I didn't run my text through any AI prompt, it still looks okay. The point with running our transcribed text through an AI prompt is that many times, and this applies to all of the applications that use Whisper, by the way, I mean, there's some limitations on regards to how the model works. It will not insert line breaks between paragraphs, for example. Sometimes it will make mistakes with punctuation marks. So even if it's simple stuff, you can ask it, you know what, can you clean up my text? Can you just make sure that all the punctuation is correct? And of course, you can start to do more things. Here in Mac Whisper, here is where the things start to get a little bit frustrating for me. Let me start dictating and I will change to an AI prompt. So here I am. And now I have to go here. have to click, select translate to Spanish for example and now I will be talking to my microphone and I will stop the recording. And as you can see it didn't translate to Spanish. This is a bug obviously because I have to click then I have to stop recording and then I have to restart again. And as you can see also it didn't insert any punctuation marks anymore. So there's something wrong there the first time it worked okay the second one so so and now i am talking and the text that i am speaking out should come out in spanish and there we go um now it worked but only after i stopped recording and then started again so it becomes a little bit annoying to be honest. I think this can be fixed. Also, the way that the text is inserted is character by character, which I think also is not ideal because if you dictate a lot, it will go like typing text by text. And let me just do another test because the cool thing about using AI prompts is that not only you can make sure that it has the correct punctuation and command like translations and stuff like that, but you can actually start using like an AI assistant and that's what I set up in the settings that I was showing you. Let me go here. Now let me change to AI assistant. Now close and I will restart again just to make sure that the prompt is activated. Can you please tell me one paragraph how the whole AI models that take audio and transcribe to text work? See, it takes a little bit typing everything, when maybe it could be better if it could just paste all the text after it already receives it all at once. I feel like this character by character can also get problems if you are here and by accident you jump to another window and it tries to continue typing. For simple things like transcription without any prompt, or maybe for simple prompts, it's okay. When you start to get more into trying to use different prompts and trying to dictate and then having to go click here, it just feels a little bit not very effective. There's no AppleScript or URL scheme to directly trigger different prompts, and there's no way to find your dictated file after you stop recording, which is kind of scary if something goes wrong. The developer has mentioned that they plan to add a history feature soon, but we do not have that yet. Of course, it's really cool that you can do this with online models and with local models. Even the AI thing, you do not need the internet for anything. So that's really, really cool. So as negatives, in short, the interface or user experience feels a bit rough. There's limited ways to control the app. There's no history feature yet. And some advanced dictation options are missing. While the dictation feature works okay, as an advanced user, it feels a bit like an afterthought. You also need your own API tokens to have access to the best cloud models. This is actually not a real negative. This is just something to be aware of. I still appreciate the option to have these cloud models, to be honest. On the positive side, it is a one-time payment for about $40. You get amazing transcription features. For file transcription and creating subtitles, it really is at the top of the game. I haven't seen any other Whisper app offer this amount of advanced settings that can be super helpful if you are dealing with difficult or noisy audio files. I can only expect that dictation and user experience will likely improve over time. Another positive is that the developer is very responsive and updates the app frequently. As I told you, Mac Whisper allows local processing, and this is also great for privacy or if you are in a place without internet access. Despite some limitations, I think it's totally worth the investment. especially if you do video work and need subtitles or transcriptions. It's also great if you are looking for some basic but accurate dictation without lots of bells and whistles. Okay, the next application that I want to cover here is Whisperflow. And Whisperflow is very popular recently. And to be honest, it's a little bit of a tough one to talk about. I will try to be very objective here. Right away, you open the app and it just feels so natural, so nice, very minimal. you can quickly realize that this app was built with voice at its core, and it's not just one extra feature like it feels on Mac Whisper. And here we just have Home, Dictionary, History, Settings. We have something like a dictionary also on Mac Whisper. For example, let me go to Mac Whisper, and to find the dictionary, here we have to go inside Settings, and Find and Replace, which basically does the same. you can give some words here that you want to always be transcribed correctly. But as you can see, the difference of settings, it makes sense, because in MacWhisperer you do have so many other things to deal with, but many of the things don't actually have to do with dictation. And here, the actual settings that you have for dictation are so minimal. You don't have to choose different models. You do not have to choose or set different AI prompts. Actually, here, even though you can customize your hotkeys and all that, you don't even have to mess with all of those settings. You can right away go to a note or an input field. And just, I am pressing down the FN key and I'm holding it down and I'm talking to my microphone. And I want some text to appear on my front app the moment that I release my FN key. And the moment I release it, there it is. and it has the correct commas, the correct periods. It just feels very intuitive. And if I don't want to be holding down the key, I can also just lock it down, like with FN and the space bar. So I'm not using my hands to press any keys down. And it's recording in a very similar way as it was doing with Mac Whisperer. If I want to stop, I just have to press the keyboard shortcut again. and there we go my text appears on my front app and it's not typing character by character like we were seeing and still feels very very fast actually it feels much faster than mac whisper even with the cloud models now even though the user doesn't set different ai prompts or if they want to use ai or not my guess is that there's still some ai processing going on on top of the transcribed text, because depending on where you are on your system, or depending on the content that you dictate, it will be formatted very cleanly and very nicely. And actually, there's something else that is called flow commands. And in Mac Whisper, for example, if I want to change to a different AI prompt, I have to go and then click there, and then I can use it as an AI assistant. but here it seems to me like by using a word or a phrase the application will recognize this and it will automatically switch it for you. So I can say, Flo, explain to me in a couple of sentences how AI dictation works. And there we go. I didn't have to go and change anything by using my voice alone. it kind of like switched mode to this AI assistant. All of these things that I have been showing you, dictating or even using this as an AI assistant, is something that you can do with Mac Whisper, even though it's a little bit slower and even though it feels a little bit clunkier or you need to do more of a manual process. but you start to have here some more features that are a little bit more advanced because you can do stuff on selected text, for example. I select text and I can order something. Flow, expand this text talking about the same topic. And there it is. So, it kind of understands context. Not only that, but I can also, for example, ask it to open websites. Ask Perplexity was the capital of Mexico. And there we go. It sends me to the Perplexity website. And it is just so cool. I mean, it just feels really, really nice. Let me close this and let me go back to my note. So the way that different actions or different modes are used by voice is kind of mind-blowing. It's kind of magical. Now, this starts to become a little bit concerning because you don't know how much this application is reading from your screen or listening to you or grabbing whatever you type and stuff like that. because, for example, I don't even have to have text selected, and I can ask stuff from whatever I have here on top of me. Flow, in just two sentences, describe to me what it says on the top, because it's still very difficult for me to understand. There we go. I didn't have to select anything, and it understood that I'm talking about AI dictation. It simplified this text. This context awareness, even though it looks cool, also makes me a bit concerned. The app only works online, which means that it is sending data somewhere. The website does mention that they care about your privacy, but the extent of data capture and how it is used is not clear. The development team seems to keep all of this information secret, which, to be honest, is kind of worrying. Their marketing efforts are impressive, for sure, but their behavior on some platforms like Reddit, where they keep promoting the app and then deleting their posts or throwaway accounts whenever there's some criticism, well, this has been definitely questionable. And I'm not making this up, I have seen it firsthand. The positives of the app include a very user-friendly interface, accuracy, speed, and both transcription and AI assistant capabilities in a very intuitive way. Another good thing is that it's developed by a team, potentially meaning faster development and better support. On the negative side, well, for me, it's mainly the lack of transparency. It's unclear what's being captured on your system, and the app adds itself as a login item each time that you open it. It constantly sends data over the internet and uses significant system resources, even when not in use. There's that, and for more advanced users that want to have more control, the lack of customization options and settings is also very limiting. Another negative that I see is that Whisperflow is a subscription-only app. I mean, I told you that this is a tough one. Even though the app is a very powerful tool and overall it feels great to use, the privacy concerns and lack of transparency from the team make me quite uncomfortable. I hope not to get many dislikes for this, but I will be uninstalling it after this review. Whether it's worth the subscription price depends on your needs and comfort level with these issues. Now I want to briefly talk about Super Whisper. And Super Whisper is an application that is packed with features and flexibility in a way that, in my opinion, goes beyond the last two. So it's a little bit difficult for me to keep this brief. And let me start this by showing you not the settings. Let's see how Super Whisper can do what we did with the previous two apps. I will be pressing the keyboard shortcut to start dictating, and I will hold it, then I will release. Here I am talking to the microphone, and I am dictating some text, and the moment that I release the keyboard shortcut, my text will appear in my front application. And there we go. It appears super fast. depending on the model, and we will look at that in one second, it can be just as fast as Whisper Flow. Very fast and very natural if you want to be holding down the keys or also you can just lock the recording. And in this way I'm not even pressing down the keyboard shortcut and it's still capturing my voice and the moment that I press the keyboard shortcut again it will just paste very fast. And again, it just goes there to my front application. Okay, now what I was showing you before in Whisperflow of using it as an AI assistant, we can also do something very similar here. I need you to tell me in a couple of sentences how the whole AI dictation works, because I'm having trouble understanding this. I ask this and it answers my question. It's no longer dictating. And I can select this, and this is something that we didn't see in Mac Whisper, but I was telling you it's an advanced feature in Whisper Flow. I can select it and just say, please expand on this topic. I still need a few more sentences. And there we go. I didn't have to say anything else. It was able to understand my selected text and expand on it. Not only that, I can also go a little bit below and again, ask. Now, if I was, what I need you is to give me some, some keywords for me to understand what this is all about. Just some keywords of the topic that I have been discussing here in this document. And again, there we go. Without selecting text, it understood my request. It understood the rest of the text on my application. That is just to show you that this app can behave in a similar way in regards to the advanced features of Whisperflow. It doesn't have what is the commands to open websites and all that. Maybe it will be incorporated at some point. It's not a deal breaker for me because what you get, on the other hand, is an incredible amount of flexibility that you do not have anywhere else. The settings window is not as simple as Whisperflow, but unlike Mac Whisper, you can see that all of these configuration options still feel very focused on voice dictation and how the app behaves in relation to that. If you feel like all of this is too much, you can hide some of the advanced features, but I think that you are missing out if you do that. This is still very easy to navigate. And down here, you can set it so that the app behaves not only like what I showed you, but you can have a recording window that we will look at in a moment. And I will also disable paste. Super Whisper has something called modes. Let me show you. With the different modes, You can set different system prompts with different models, and you can decide if you want this mode to use copy text, or if you want this mode to use application context. And the application context is grabbed by the accessibility API of your system. The developer on this application, on something like Whisperflow, here he is super, super transparent. Actually, every time that you do some dictation, you have access to all the text that the model received. And here, for example, I can see user is currently using Bear. Focus on this element, and then it shows all my text from my input field. if I have text on my clipboard, and if I chose to use that in the specific mode, it will be able to grab it there. So having access to this alone, it just allowed me to understand so much more how the application works. And the one thing that this doesn't have, as I was telling you, is the different commands for different actions. So to switch between different modes, I cannot do that only by using voice. What I was doing in the example that I showed you at the beginning, I was using a different keyboard shortcut to activate a different mode. And for me, that still feels very intuitive, specifically because I have many different modes set up for myself. It's not just like one mode for dictating and one mode for AI kind of tasks. here I have so many different modes. And something that I really appreciate also from Super Whisperer is that it gives me so many more automation opportunities. That's why I was even able to create this Alfred workflow. So I can very simply select a mode and start dictating in it or just switch between modes. I also can jump to the settings, to the history. I can toggle recording. So all of this I cannot do with Mac Whisper. I cannot do with Whisper Flow because they don't have this kind of deep links or URL scheme or AppleScript. Here I can even show on my menu bar, which is my actual mode. And this is something that I did with Keyboard Maestro. So I always know where I am. I always know what I have to press. I have different keyboard shortcuts to jump between different modes. Very intuitive for me as well. Maybe not as simple as using voice, but for me, using voice alone in this kind of application feels limiting. So going from this to Whisperflow, I just feel like they put me in kind of a cage, you know. Here we have different AI models. We have the possibility of using cloud models with your own API token if you want that, or you can use some models locally that you can download. Language models included on the application, you can use any of this without using your API tokens. This is super, super nice because as these are popular models, you already know kind of like what a model is good for. So this combined with modes allows me to, for example, have one coding mode to use with Sony 3.5 or a dictating mode to use with GPT-4.0 mini or a mode to come up with grading ideas using Haiku. You know, all of that because of the control that the user has and because of the power that the developer has allowed the user to have access to with all of these settings, with all of this configuration. My favorite apps are those that allow you to expand your interaction with them, with your own needs, ideas, and customization. And because of that, I love this. There's so much to say about Super Whisper. It really is one of my most used and favorite apps right now. So, as positives, Super Whisper, in my opinion, has the perfect amount of features to be used either for dictation or as an AI assistant. Like I said, you have total control over customizing different modes. I use it for writing ideas, structuring outlines, summarizing, coding, dictating and helping with grammar, or structuring video scripts like the one that you're watching right now. Super Whisper also has similar context awareness features as Whisper Flow. This feature is optional and you can set it up per mode, but it's amazing for interacting with both typed text and voice. As I was telling you, with Super Whisper, not only you have the option of pasting the result directly on your front window, like the previous two applications do, but you also have the option of having that separate recording window that we saw in the settings. and I actually use that a lot more because I can go to any application or I can be on any website and I can select some text and I can say, please simplify this for me because it's too complicated for me to understand. And in this kind of situation, of course, I don't need the text pasted to my front window. and in case I do need that I can just go to a note and I can just paste because I know that I have that on my clipboard. Super Whisperer offers a subscription but aside from that there's also a lifetime payment option currently priced at $250. It took me like five minutes of testing the app to decide to buy it not only because of all the features but also I don't know where else I'll find unlimited access to models like Sonnet 3.5 or GPT-40 at this kind of price. I know that new models are coming out every other day, but what is included here is really, really good and the developer keeps the app up to date. The negatives? Well, the lifetime option isn't exactly cheap. I think it's absolutely worth it, but it's a bit of an investment off front. You can also go with a subscription if you prefer. If you are not into tinkering with settings, you might also find it a little bit overwhelming at first. There's definitely a learning curve for the more advanced stuff. While one of Super Whisperer's biggest strengths is all of the settings and control that the user can have, this can also lead to confusion and misunderstandings about how the app works. My biggest concern with Super Whisperer is that currently it seems that it's only one developer handling coding, marketing, business, and customer service. While most effort goes into app development and fixing serious bugs, I just don't know how much bandwidth there is for growth. So far, I can see that important bugs and issues from users do get attention. It just worries me a bit because I've seen app developers become totally unreachable after getting more popular, and I think that this app has the potential to become pretty big. So, unless there's a few more team members, I don't know about this in the future. It's still impressive that the developer has done everything by himself, and I'm grateful to have this app. So I'm very, very happy to recommend it. I told you that I wanted to give you a way to do this for free, and there's this application on the App Store, which is called iCo. And iCo also uses Whisper for transcription, and actually this application is not originally made for dictation, but the really, really cool thing about this app, Well, number one, it's free. Number two, it uses Whisper models, which are very accurate, like I was showing you and telling you before. But this one has integration with shortcuts. So I created a small shortcut that I will be sharing with you. Basically, with iCode, and let me go to the Shortcuts app. Let me open the shortcut that I made. I have another application, which is called LM Studio. And with LM Studio, you can download open source AI models. And there's, for example, Lama 3.2, which is pretty good. And you can set up like a local server. And this works totally offline. I will start it here. Start. And here with a shortcut, you do not even have to change anything. And this shortcut will work offline. using ICO and LM Studio. If you have something like Olama, you probably have to go down here and change the URL for that, but it also works with cloud models if you want. So if you enter cloud here and if you enter your token here in this space, then it will use OpenAI Whisper and it will use the model that you set here. So this shortcut can work both for local or for online. And again, like we saw before, everything will depend on the system prompt. So here we have this field where you can say you are a translator. Hello, I am just testing this and I'm making sure that it works properly. And again, the Ico takes that sends it to LM Studio and I get the result and I set it like this as a pop-up because I feel like this shortcut is so basic and it's a great opportunity for you to also understand how this works if you want a behavior like the one that we were getting in the other apps you can actually just put some script there Apple script so that it can press command v one thing I have to mention is that the shortcuts app has this time limitation when making online requests. If it takes too long, the app will quit. This is a problem because if your dictation is too long and LM Studio takes a while, or if OpenAI Server is slow to transcribe everything, then it will time out and you will end up with nothing. But don't worry, if that happens, know that the latest transcription file, the audio file, is always in your shortcuts folder. That's a good backup, and you can just go there, select the right click and share it to the shortcut to try transcribing again. That's there as a safety net so you don't lose your last dictation. If you plan to use this for longer recordings, for that case I actually created a copy of the shortcut and I connected it to Keyboard Maestro as a macro. and I will be giving you also that one in the description of the video, in that link. And with that one, you don't have to worry about the limitation of the Shortcuts app because the actual processing with the local model will be done by Keyboard Maestro, and that's much more flexible. Again, that one will also appear as a pop-up, and you can just decide to paste it or do something else with it. For even longer files, you probably have to do some tests, and you probably will want to do everything with Keyboard Maestro and skip the shortcuts app totally. But that's beyond the simple alternative that I wanted to share here. As I'm wrapping up this video, I just want to tell you, if you want the absolutely best that I have tried so far, there's Super Whisperer. Also, a few months ago, I made an Alfred workflow called Kiki, and the reason that I'm so familiar with this topic is because Kiki incorporates a similar functionality to Super Whisperer. You can do a lot of the same things. The problem is, well, it's not super easy to set up. There's a long documentation, and maybe in the future I will make some more tutorials for it. But unless you know how to deal with AppleScript and trigger Alfred workflows externally with arguments and all that, you probably don't want to mess with it. It's also super powerful, and you use it with your own API tokens. But I just found this new app, and well, Super Whisper gives me very good models for a one-time payment. so I am mostly using this for now. If you don't want advanced features, there's Mac Whisper, which is a bit rough on the edges when it comes to dictation, but still very good for its price, especially if you also need file transcriptions and subtitle creation. As I said, I can only expect this app to get better with time. But if you need dictation alone, maybe you'll be totally okay with something like the shortcut that I shared with you. Keep in mind that using it with cloud models, it will be faster than using it with local models. And a lot of the quality in the output depends on the system prompt that you set for it. That's something to be aware of. Then there's Whisperflow that I mentioned earlier. Honestly, aside from the negatives, I think it's a very good application. If they decide to change how they deal with transparency and privacy, and if they can incorporate local models, or maybe if they can make it a native app to be faster and not take up so many resources, then I think it can become a very good option if you don't mind a subscription. It's just not personally worth it for me. But if they fix all the other issues with privacy and the shady behavior, who knows? It really feels very good to use. I'll leave that one up to you to decide. There are many other AI applications that also incorporate whisper transcription. So if you're a developer who made one of these apps and you want to promote it, feel free to leave a comment on the video with the name of your app, how it stands against what I have mentioned, and a link to it. I will not remove it. I think it's always good to have options. Thank you so much for watching, guys. I will be grabbing an article version of this video with a link to the shortcut and keyword maestro macro if you want to grab that from the description. Remember that you can sign up for my newsletter for more frequent updates on what I'm up to, and I'll talk to you soon."

        "srt": "[Music] Hello everyone, welcome to Wharton Tech Talks. I'm your host Taneka and today we have Tanekari. He is the co-founder and CEO of Whistler Flow, an AI powered voice first productivity tool designed to help professionals communicate faster and more naturally. Tani has been obsessed with building technology since his teenage years, launching over 50 apps and he has represented India at an international computing and linguistic competition. Before Whisper, he worked on AI and product teams at leading startups to gain hands-on experience building scalable AIdriven platforms. Whisper Flow is a pioneering screen first, voice first future, where professionals can dictate messages, edit with natural language, voice commands, and boost productivity, which is over three times faster than typing. Backed by NEA, 8VC and other top AI leaders, Whisper Flow has raised 26 million to redefine the way we interact with technology. Welcome, Tan. >> Hey, Taneka, thanks for having me here. >> Awesome. So could you share a little bit more about your background and the inception of Whisper? >> Yeah, of course. We started the company some time back, but it's been an idea that I've been working on for pretty much the last 16 years, which is what should the next generation of computing really feel like. Back in 2008 when the first Iron Man movie came out, I wanted to build Jarvis. So me and a friend of mine built what was then one of the world's first voice assistants. And to people, it just felt like magic. It grew to about 2 and a half million users. Google shut us down with a cease and desist. My dad was mad at me. It was a whole series of things that happened. But to me, this idea was just very top of mind for the next decade pretty much, which was really like tapping on icons on a screen and clicking keys on a keyboard as the best way to communicate just feels like a ridiculous idea to me. So when I think about technology, what it should really feel like, I want it to be something that understands me, maybe even better than I understand myself. I want it to be something where interacting with it feels just as natural as interacting with other people. And if you're building a system like this, then it eventually becomes something that becomes a part of people's identity. And everything that we're building at Whisper now is all in those lines of where we want technology to go towards. >> That's incredible. And that's a funny story about you watching Iron Man and then just wanting to build this product out of that. But with so much of our work today happening on screens, what do you see as the biggest challenge in people transitioning to just a voice first future? I think a lot of what we do on our computers today, you can divide it into categories. For some things, you do need a screen. If you're consuming content, you need a screen. If you're reading large swats of text, you need a screen. If you're in discovery mode, you're looking at a bunch of options, maybe you're shopping for a new dress, all of that, you need a screen. But for a lot of small things, you don't. You don't need a screen to quickly reply to a text message. You don't need a screen to send a new calendar invite. And there's a whole list of things there. The thing that I'm really going after is for a lot that you do today on your phones and your laptops. What parts of it are just way better to have as a voice first interface and let's build that so you aren't building towards a world where people are stuck on their screens always. They can do a lot which is something that exists in the background and them as people can be a lot more present with their heads up looking out into the world. >> Yeah, that's very fair. So what do you think was like one of the first few use cases that at Whisper you guys have been focusing on kind of guiding people to use voice versus their keyboards and looking at screens. >> The biggest thing that we started off with so actually whisper flow was the eighth product that we built internally. The first seven were what you would expect if you hear voice interfaces. It would do actions for you. I could say things like, \"Hey, I want to meet Taneka for dinner. Can you make a reservation at a restaurant nearby?\" Send her a message and make a calendar invite. And it did all of that. It was beautiful. And this I'm talking about 2021. So this is pre when AI agents were a real thing. But the thing was nobody in our company used it. I used it maybe once and then I forgot it existed. Because what we realized is when you're building any consumer tool, what you need is to really have people build a habit. And you can't build a habit with very infrequent use cases. So then what we built towards was voice dictation. Super simple. You speak naturally and it writes perfectly formatted in your style across all your applications. It went from something that I maybe used once a day to a tool that I now use hundreds of times a day. And some people use actually this a lot more than even I do. And that has really strong habit building potential. >> So that's really how I think about scaling back product development is building the one thing people do 100 times a day. Then the 10 things that people do 10 times a day and then we go and build a 100 things that people would do one time a day because at that point they're already bought in. They're already using it and now we're just adding a lot more value. >> That makes sense. I'm a huge fan of the product. I use it a lot. myself, but for our audience who might not be familiar, could you tell us how is it different from something like a auto AI or something like voice to text that you use on your iPhone? >> If you have ever used voice to text to send a message to anybody, you know that you are terrified at what it's going to produce and if you're going to have to go back and fix the mistakes that it makes. Flow doesn't make mistakes. It's primarily because we've optimized it to get you outputs that don't need editing. It's very specifically what we built the platform for. And it came from an insight that we had which was people speak very differently than they write. You stammer, you stutter, you change your mind halfway while speaking. You speak in long rambles and sentences that are 100 words long. But when you're writing that is not what you want to write at all. So flow does small things like if I say hey let's meet at 5:00 actually you know what let's do 6 p.m. Flo writes hey let's meet at 6 p.m. cuz that is literally what I would have written if I give it a long set of things like hey I have three thoughts here like firsta d and all of that flow would format my message when I'm dropping it in slack as bullet points so my team doesn't bang their head against the wall and try to read like a whole thing that I send them but it's instead a very structured message. These are few things that we do that just make people use flow for everything and make it to a point where people don't really have to edit that much. >> That's fair. And would you say when people see the quality and caliber of what flow can do in terms of reducing editing that feeds into your thesis that it'll become more of a habit that people use every day? >> It does. And initially it was a hypothesis. Six months ago when we launched the product, we had no idea how people were actually going to use it. All we knew was for the six people on the team how we like to use it. But people keep surprising us day in day out. For people who've used Flow for a month, did you know that they use Flow more than their keyboard on their computers? Measurably. And this is the first time any software on the planet has replaced people's keyboards. This has never happened before in the history of computing. Keyboards have just been as much of a staple as you can imagine. Right. >> Definitely. I mean, spending less time typing and more time speaking would definitely make communication more personal as well, which is something that I'm excited to see. Could you tell us about like a pivotal moment that you faced early on that kind of set in stone that what you're doing is the right thing for you. Yeah, I think it was the example that I'd given earlier about going from building a tool that does actions for you to voice dictation. And for a lot of people who look to start companies, right? If somebody was like came to me like T, let's start a voice dictation company. I'd be like, that doesn't really sound sexy. This exists in so many places. Like I don't know about this. Somebody's like, oh, let's build this thing that can control your computer and do all these cool actions. Like that sounds a lot sexier. But when you actually get down to it, it doesn't really matter what it sounds like. What matters is do people use it? Does it build habit? Do people pay for it? Is this on a path to a much larger vision that you have? And on that note, like a big realization I had is there's no feature or product that's big or small. It doesn't matter how cool something sounds. All that matters at the end of the day is what your users tell you. >> That makes sense. Can you tell us about your journey like how you took from scaling your idea of whisper to a fully operational business today? >> Yeah, the first versions of Whisper we had internally. We gave it to a few users and the base slowly grew on from there. And for a long time we decided actively not to charge people for it. We wanted to see okay if you just have this product does this build have it? And we didn't want to put any blockers in front of people for that. So we got that got it to a point and it was really funny because we had the other problem where people were skeptical. Why is this product for free? This product is so good. Are they selling my data? How is this company not charging for it? And in October of last year, we decided to launch the paid plans. And to our surprise, a lot of people started paying for it. So usually I was expecting 5% of users to pay for the product which is what you see as usual for any company. You compare the Dropboxes, notions and all in the world and our numbers were more than twice that of the percent of people that were switching over to being paid users. That to us was a big sign like okay this is adding a lot of value to people's lives and for some reason they really want to pay for it. And then was the second phase of it of let's really start to understand what the user journey looks like. Spending time with people and like what made you download this application? How did you hear about it? What made you want to start using it more? What was your first aha moment? Why did you pay for this thing? Why did you not pay for this thing? and really getting answers to all the questions was really helpful to revamp the whole user journey and flow that we have restructure the company to start to put itself in a lot more product first mature way starting to onboard larger enterprises teams and so on and it's just going from there but I think a big part of it was just leading with curiosity and all of those questions at every step of the way helped drive the transitions that we needed to make pretty much at this point every two months. >> That's great. And I'm glad to hear you got such good feedback from your customers and you're seeing it in growth in paid users. But could you tell us a little bit about what strategies you're using to grow your user base and expand your market presence? I've seen that really funny video that you have of taking the axe to the keyboard or this bus or whatever. But apart from that, are there any other marketing strategies that you've used? >> Yeah. Yeah, a bunch of them. So one thing that makes marketing our product very unique is people by default hate voice dictation. Like if you say Siri, you just see the disgust on people's faces, right? That's the best experience they've had. >> So we can't go out there ourselves and be like we have really good voice dictation for you. Cuz people are like, \"Yeah, Siri's been saying that for the last 10 years and I know what they give me.\" And for a lot of products that can just do that, that leads to very different marketing channels. Ours had to be a lot more social proof driven. So instead of that, the things that we had is how do we empower our users to post more about it to share it in different places so that they users are not just seeing like hey this is a tool. This is just people saying this is what Apple should have built and people are like huh that is right. city does suck, but is there something better? And it grabs their attention. And I would say 95% of our growth has just been organic through word of mouth referrals, through users posting it on Slack channels, users like you putting me on podcasts. So we can dive a bit more into flow and I can share more of the stories behind it. >> Yeah, this is a shout out to all the listeners. Please try it out. I think it's fantastic and it'll save you a lot of time. and then tell you about one of my favorite features which is the auto editing tool. Could you tell the audience about how the system works? How does it understand context to make real-time corrections when people are speaking? That way it's different from the other dictation tools as you mentioned where you have to pause and it calibrates what you said. Here it actually listens, understands and then edits. >> Yeah, that's a huge part. You know, when I think about flow, I I think about less as voice dictation like a tool like Otter and more so as if there was a person sitting on your computer and you are telling them some email to send whatever. What would they do? Well, if you like this person, then they're most likely competent. They're very good at writing. They have a good understanding of you. So, if you're a professional, you write professional emails, they're not going to drop in emojis in there. And third is they are reliable. So they reliably work every single time and you can trust them. That is really important. Those were the characteristics that we wanted to build into the product. For example, Tanek, if I'm sending a message to you, it's never going to get your name wrong. It's like right there on the screen. It's crazy to me that other things get your name wrong and other things don't use this context that is very readily available. The other things that we do is instead of writing everything you say word for word we have built our own models that understand you what you're saying what the context is and based on that what really should be written and there's one thing that we're going to be be building out soon is for it to sometimes give you suggestions as well based on how you usually write on what you could do better ways in which you could improve right there and then less so on grammar grammar and such, but more so just the content of your ideas cuz it starts to have context of what you're saying across different applications. If you wrote something in notion, then you're writing an email somewhere else. It starts to build a better mental model of you. >> That's fair. And so it kind of learns and understands what the user likes and what the user talks about and what apps the user uses becomes more intelligent. the more you use it, the better it understands you and the more effectively you can use the tools. That's great. >> And you've mentioned that you're trying to build a world where people aren't glued to their screens all day. What would you imagine a voice first world to look 10 years from now? >> I walk down the street looking around. People are not stuck on their phones texting away. They are just looking up. you as just people can just enjoy a lot more of what the world looks like, what people around you and interact more with them. Things like screen time and such feel like outdated concepts. I feel like tracking screen time and trying to reduce screen time is a band-aid solution to the problem we have, which is literally everything you do, you need to stare at a screen to do it. And then we're like, \"Oh, we're going to reduce screen time and we're going to download like five apps that block other apps and do this other thing.\" And it's like, yes, sure, but that is not the way to really do it. What you really need to do is kind of rethink the problem from the ground up, which is humans weren't meant to stare at screens all the time. We're meant to communicate. We're meant to be understood. We're meant to share some context, see things happen. I recently tried out this tool, Sesame AI, where it's like a voice assistant speaking back to you. Are you familiar with the tool? Have you thought about whether you want Whisper to eventually speak back to the user using the tool or what would you say is the next step? You mentioned also uh replacing the 100 habits that a single user does versus just changing one habit. Could you just talk about which of the two would you think would be a natural transition from your existing product? >> Having the computer speak back to you is useful in some situations. I don't think it's a catch all for everything. >> Primarily cuz sometimes if you're consuming content or like if I'm learning something more about a topic, your eyes read information so much faster than your ears can even try to process. Mhm. >> If I was trying to listen to something that I'm learning about, my impatience would get the better of me and I'll probably close the thing. I think audio output is good for certain situations and we're definitely going to build that in. The way I think about it is like, okay, let's take a workflow. What is the best experience for this workflow? Does it need to have voice output? If so, we'll add that. Does it even need to have voice input? Cuz in some situations, maybe your voice is not the best way to interact with it. you need something different and we'll build the thing that we need to just for writing voice is the best that you have. So we decided to build it that way and instead of hearing back what you said like Siri repeats back to you it's just way better to quickly glance at it on the screen. Even better if you start trusting the system and you never have to read the outputs again which is what I do. I just genuinely speak the thing and I press send. I don't even read what flow writes anymore. I know it's probably going to write the right thing. That's great that you have such implicit trust and hopefully your users feel the same way and they continue. >> We do track that across users on how long they spend when the text space on the screen >> and the time before they press enter within 2 weeks. 90% of the time it's under half a second. >> Most people for most things don't wait and read what flow writes. If at any point that drops that is a big flag to us that we need to go change it. >> Sure. Yeah. Fair enough. That's a cool metric to track. Are there any other interesting metrics that you've noticed through your user adoption? Maybe number of words spoken before they become like a lifetime user or something of that sort. >> There are some metrics like that. A couple that I find really interesting is the number of applications that they use flow in. So when I think about the user journey a person has with the product, >> they have the first aha moment during onboarding when they do their first dictation >> cuz it is insanely accurate, insanely fast and that's the first time they have experienced anything like that. They're like, \"Oh, holy This is awesome. I was not expecting this at all.\" The second aha moment comes when they find their first use case. It could be somebody responding to all their emails, all their Slacks, using it in cursor or wind surf. They could be using it to talk to other AI systems. >> Mhm. >> Pick one. They love using that and they're like, \"Okay, whenever I do this thing, I'm just going to use flow.\" That's the first habit that they build. And a couple of weeks from then is when they get to a point where they're typing on the keyboard somewhere and they're like, \"This is so painful. Why am I doing this?\" And that's when you see an explosion happen. For people who've used the product for a bit, on average, they are using Flow in across 90 different apps and websites. >> Wow, that's incredible. >> I know. I was shocked when I saw that number and I had to double check like a few times. I was like, is this real? Did I do something wrong? I was like, no, it's genuinely it's literally everything that they use. >> I think I need to think of creative ways to expand my usage horizon across more apps. Then I'll take this up as a challenge. >> Yeah. Shifting gears a little. So you guys have raised a significant amount of money. Could you talk to us about when you decided to raise? What was the process speaking to investors? How did you choose the investors to raise form and any advice that you have for aspiring entrepreneurs seeking for investments for their startups? >> Yep, happy to share some highle notes that really help me along my way. And then of course people's situations are different. So there's very unique advice I would have if I'm talking to somebody. Number one for flow made sense for us to raise from day one because we knew we needed good amount of capital to get this thing off the ground. We did that. In general with fundraisers, what you want to do as a founder is you want to have it happen in a very compressed time frame. We started the fund raise on a Monday and we told everybody we are going to close this and finalize allocations by Friday of the next week. Essentially 12-day time period. And a couple of weeks before that was when we had planned all the meetings for those two weeks. So you want to make sure everything is running at the same time. Everybody that you're talking to is running on the same schedule >> cuz the last thing you want is you receive a term sheet from somebody and you are in first stage first calls with other people. Same as applying to jobs, right? You don't have negotiating power, which is not good. So the goal is to get as much negotiating power as you possibly can, which is what happens. Then other things that were really helpful for us is for all the WC's we try to get warm intros and get the people introing us to hype us up. The conversation is already starting on a good note and we don't have to spend the first 10 minutes trying to build credibility. It's already there and so we can build on top of that and get to dream together. Note I'd make about pitch decks. There's a lot of questions that come around there. Do I need a pitch deck? Shall I just wing it and have a conversation? Shall I make a memo? I generally think use a pitch deck as essentially a presentation guide. I keep my pitch decks really short about seven, eight slides, tops five words a slide and they're just supposed to ground what I am talking about. And in terms of the conversation, I can do that in my sleep once I start fundraising cuz everything is pre-planned. There is a script for the intros for the exact presentation. Me and my co-founder went through 150 possible questions we could get asked and we had concise and very clear answers written for every single one of them that we nailed down. And when you go into any conversation with that level of preparedness, it feels to the other person like a deep sense of confidence. You're not stammering. You are not having to think twice or ponder about questions that are coming. every single number and answer you need is at your fingertips. And that is really what investors want to see cuz it was like, okay, if you come into this conversation like this, just imagine how you're going to be running the company. And that got us to have a really successful fund raise. And honestly, for me and my co-founder, it was just really fun. It was like maybe the most fun two weeks that I had companywise. Cuz the other part of the fundra that a lot of people miss out on when you're in a constant feeling of stress is you are talking to incredible human beings. Like these people have likely built incredible companies, built really strong teams. They're extremely smart people and I have a chance to spend 30 minutes sharing about my dream with them and then get their feedback on it and maybe get them excited and have a chance to work with them. That is really special. And the underlying thing what helped with all of this was just this deep feeling of gratitude that I had going in and coming out of every single call. And I think people can really feel that people can feel what your intentions are when you're coming into to talk to them. However, subconsciously so that way it ends up becoming a lot about the mindset. >> That's great perspective and I'm sure coming in with a positive attitude it translates in your passion about building something that you love. Adjacent to that, can you talk about building the team at Whisper? What qualities do you typically look in for an early teammates that have joined your team? >> This again may not apply to everybody. This is very much culture specific to what we care about. So number one thing is we have a very high ownership team. People have about two or three days to ramp up when they join the company and after that they are building, owning and leading their own features, products, sometimes even product lines. I don't care if this is a full-time person or an intern. They're all treated the exact same way. And that is great because we are able to attract incredibly high functioning people who don't like bureaucracy who don't like constantly being told what to do cuz we generally don't have that much time to tell people what all to do. There's so many problems that we need to solve and what I feel our job is like me and my co-founder Sahedge is to lay out the vision to lay out the road map give people enough clarity where they can make those decisions by themselves and then bring the best people in for the job so that we can fully trust them with it. And if you get people who can function that independently, honestly saves so much headache. You are happier, they're happier, and your company overall is much better cuz you just let people focus on where they work best in. >> That's good. People have autonomy. And what would you say are some of the core values or pieces of culture that you've tried to instill in your startup? >> Yeah, so there's four pillars that we build upon. Number one is open communication. That is I think how you build a high level of trust and I also think integrity is the only thing you have as a person that you can never lose and what goes with that is also just assuming the best intentions in other people. So that builds a warm culture. Number two is being user obsessed. Everything that we build is for the users. They are the eventual people that really matter at the end of the day. >> Mhm. >> Third is being very very very particular about the details. Every single pixel, every single millisecond of interaction matters to the user experience and people can feel that in ways they cannot express. That matters across all fronts. Um simple example that most people don't think about is for the emails that we send out. We have incredibly low unsubscribe rates because I go through every single word and it's like does this person care? Are we adding value to this person? Are they going to read it and think that it's spam? I want to make sure that we are being empathetic to what people are thinking about when they open this email. Why are they opening this email? What do they want to get out of it? Let's get them that. And then we have a couple of goals that we want to communicate. Let's make sure those happen as well. But at some point, if you stop empathizing with the users, you just lose that interest. And that just matters in every single touch point that you have. The last part I would say is a focus on growth. like we're solving a lot of hard problems going to keep coming up. Want people who take up challenges and when a new thing comes that they don't know about, they get excited to have the opportunity to learn a new thing. >> Speaking of new things, are there any upcoming features or developments you're particularly excited about? >> Oh, there's so many. So, we just launched Windows a week ago. We just launched the iOS app yesterday. And next up, what we have is some features that a lot of people have been requesting for. We are going to be dropping in the ability to have snippets. So if there's things that you send very frequently to people, could be an intro about yourself, your address, whatever, you can just add that into flow so you don't have to say the whole thing again all the time. >> There's another way where some people want to have more control over how their messages are sent. We're adding writing styles where people can go and and edit that and give some specific instructions on how they want their messages to be formatted so they don't have to kind of go past it into Chad GPD and ask Charad GPD to do those things for them again after that. >> That's awesome. I'm excited to try them out. And my last question before we go into rapid fire, what would you say has been the most memorable experience at Whisper so far? When we were doing the first launch, it was all of us in the office together for maybe 48 hours preparing everything for it. Everything was happening last minute, right? This is the first launch of us as a company. And then we launched on product hunt and then somebody had this idea of like every 100 upwards we do some challenge. every hour somebody's doing like we're all doing push-ups together. We're all doing pull-ups together and there's just like random faceoffs that are happening in the office. I think that was one of the times where where we all just really bonded together like going through a shared struggle as a team and that was special. >> That's awesome. And congrats on being number one product to twice I think on product hunt at least that I've seen. >> That's awesome. >> Shifting towards our rapid fire round. So my first question is what is your favorite AI tool that you use today apart from whisper? >> I love using superhuman. >> Okay, that's cool. What is your wildest bet about the tech industry in the next 10 to 15 years? >> Computer science is going to be useless as a degree. >> Oh, interesting. >> That's going to happen in the next five, not even the next 10. >> Mhm. I've heard this thought that it's more so that 10x engineers are going to become even more useful versus hiring people for like product and marketing. You might just hire an engineer who has a more business mindset to replace those functions. I feel like you're in the other camp though where you think that the engineers aren't needed and you can have like the marketing growth professionals use no code tools to code. Yeah, there was a time when you needed human calculators cuz no one could do that. Then everybody had a calculator in their hands that they could use to do whatever. And those humans were out of a job. >> That is literally what's happening where you or anybody else like our entire marketing and customer support team, no one's an engineer. They all have these tools. Instead of writing documents and support tickets, they just send us like, \"Hey, I think we should build the feature this way.\" And they just send us the built feature. the engineers have to then properly build it into production. But the number of engineers we need is like it's not that high now and we're only going to get the best of the best. And if it's the biggest major in the world right now, one of the largest ones that is producing people, a lot of them are not going to get jobs. >> Interesting. And finally, what's the best career advice you've ever received? Best career advice that I've received is to genuinely care about people. And there are some very specific tactical things that go in this. For example, what I do when somebody new joins team is I want to understand what are the best ways in which this person learns. People learn in very different ways and I want to know that. And what are the best ways in which this person likes to get feedback? both positive and negative and knowing that I shouldn't apply the same model to every single person has I think been one of the biggest unlocks to the kind of manager that I am today. >> That's great. And I'm glad that you have that realization of getting to know your team better and coailing that your specific feedback and interaction style based on what their preferences are. I'm sure that'll go a long way. >> Mhm. >> But from my side, that's it. That's all the questions that I had for you. Thank you so much for joining and I hope you have a great rest of your day. >> Danica, pleasure is all mine. This was fantastic."

        "srt": "okay I'm so intrigued by this software so this is called whisper flow and this is essentially a dictation software that runs on your computer it is available on Mac and windows and essentially you can use it to record your voice and then transcribe that into words so if you want to send a message on slack or maybe reply an email or maybe tweet something on Twitter or X you can just say it and then it will transcribe your word accurately now you might be thinking why do you need AI here I mean why do you combine AI with dictation well because AI can correct the mistake on your speech and also sometimes you probably say something that you are not meant or you want to scrap the other part of your uh Speech then AI will understand the request and will only type the thing that you want to send okay uh I basically have installed this program on my computer and now I can use it immediately by the way if you want to use it you can go to whisper flow. a and uh you can get this for free it is available for free and Premium plan there is a free plan that will give you 2,000 words of uh transcription per week which I think quite a lot and then there is a flow Pro if you want to get more features but I think the basic is good enough at least for a lot of people and after that uh you have to log in to your account that is only Google Apple and Microsoft login there is no email so you have to prepare prepare one of these accounts and after that you will get one free uh sorry two weeks or free trial which I think pretty good and this is the interface of of the program and actually in the onboarding process it is going to ask you about uh what keyboard shortcut that you have to that you prefer to use to enable the dictation and in this case I'm using Windows so I'm using control and ALT on my key to enable that and uh I do recommend to go to settings and change the output language to your preferred language because from my testing apparently it is uh using the language where I'm I'm right now but it's that's not accurate so I have to specify here that I'm using English that's something that you probably want to check and by the way I will leave the link in the video description so you can uh sign in and sorry sign up to flow and use this software now I want to give you the demonstration so I'm going to go to Twitter or X and this is the tweet from Manus I will say something like this I will press contrl and ALT on my keyboard and then you will see that there's going to be an icon at the bottom that will show you that the transcription is being enabled that's amazing I'm looking forward to use Manus on my video okay I release that and now there you go that's amazing I'm looking forward to use to using Manus on my video and I can just send the message that's really the idea of uh whisper flow you can say it without uh you don't have to type it but it's even better let's say I want to send a prom I want to craft an AI prompting let's say I say something like this generate an article draft with 500 words oh sorry it is 1,000 words you see it doesn't say anything about the correction it only focus on the thing that I want to send I said initially I said 500 but then I change to 1,000 and AI in whisper flow understand that and it will adjust the output accordingly so I think this is pretty clever I think simple and yet quite useful so yeah I'm really intrigued and I'm looking forward to using uh Vis flow on my uh daily task and I will probably make more video tutorial about this software but that's basically it I think the software is not very complicated there are not many settings that you have to worry about and the onboarding process is really amazing it's extremely useful and you can also speak in different languages I think there are 100 languages that are supported here so if you're not an English speaker not a problem there are plenty of other uh specific languages that you can use but anyway if you find this video to be useful and if you want to see more uh video like this then please consider subscribing to this channel in any case thank you so much for watching and I'll see you around"

        "srt": "AI dictation tools could be the future of how we work and let me tell you why by incorporating AI into traditional speech to text software these new tools are able to use AI to understand exactly what you're trying to say and then format the text into your specific style for the exact application that you're using so in theory an email should be formatted differently than a text and a text should be formatted differently than a slack message and a slack message should be formatted differently than the instructions that you'd feed to a code editor like cursor and that's what these AI dictation tools claim to do if you're anything like me you probably tried the text to speech feature on your iPhone to do something like respond to a text while driving but when you look at what it actually writes after the fact you realize it got something wrong so you have to go in and manually edit it which defeats the entire purpose of using the text to speech feature in the first place but if one of these AI dictation tools could get it right the first time I could see how that would be useful so in today's video I thought it would be fun to compare the three most well-known AI dictation apps to see which one's the best and also compare them to the built-in Apple speech to text feature to see if they really make a difference okay so the three tools I'll be trying out today will be whisper flow super whisper and Mac whisper taking a look at the three different pricing plans I will be using only the free plans but the free plan for whisper flow gives you 2,000 words per week so that resets Weekly which is pretty nice but 2,000 words does go pretty quick so fair warrant there if you do want to upgrade it's $15 a month to be build monthly and you basically get unlimited words per week as well as a few other Pro features and then if you want to do it yearly you get it down to $12 per month now jumping over to Mac whisper Mac whisper you actually buy through a gum Road page which I find pretty interesting here so it feels very like Indie hacker but there are 169,000 downloads which is pretty crazy a lot of people use this but the Mac whisper starts with a free plan you can just download this and use it forever but if you upgrade for $49 one time you do get access to all their Pro features which lets you access llm models like Chach BT and Claude so basically accessing these more premium models so that your results are going to be a lot better now I'm only going to use the free plan which gives you access to one of their smaller models so might not be as good as their Pro Plan but that's what we're trying out today lastly we have super whisper and super whisper is free up to the first 15 minutes using all the pro features and the pro features get you unlimited use of cloud in local AI models like open AI anthropic basically gets you all the premium models and I will say again 15 minutes goes pretty quick so you'll probably burn through that within a couple days or hours depending on how much you use it but then if you upgrade to the monthly plan it's only $8.50 annual is 85 or lifetime is 250 so if you really like it it's probably worth upgrading here because that's a pretty good deal to have this forever you also get a student discount if you're a student but that doesn't apply to me now first let's jump into whisper flow and if we take a look at whisper Flow by far they definitely have the best UI so they have the best designers is what I imagine because it just looks sort of like a clean Mac app and it's really easy to use go through the settings and it's pretty intuitive to like figure out how all of it works so like you can change the hot Keys there's just not that many options it's basically like set it up once and go right you're not choosing from a bunch of different models or trying to set up a bunch of different settings it's basically like hey set your hotkeys and then get Off to the Races you have your dashboard here which shows you like your streak and your average words per minute and the total words dictated so it kind of gamifies it which is kind of cool that's like a marketing tactic or or usage tactic to get people to use it a lot more grammarly does that as well yeah that's about it once you download it you'll be set up with this and then you'll set your hotkey so your hotkey are basically the key that you're going to hit once you want to use it it's going to be a key that you probably don't use a lot so that you're not like hitting it and accidentally turning on dictate I had it set up originally to my FN key which I use my FN key to change my volume all the time that was a problem because every time I wanted to change my volume it would come up with a dictate and it would just get annoying I highly recommend to choose a key that you don't use a lot let's go ahead and try this model out I have it set to my left control key so once I hit my left control key I can just go ahead and start talking I want to say hey there whisper um I am making a quick video right now and I just want you to uh write this out for me so I'm having a lot of fun and I think this is going to come out good see now hey there whisper I am making a quick video right now and I just want you to write this out for me I'm having a lot of fun and I think this is going to come out good so I mean that's exactly what I said hey there whisper I am maybe I'd like it to change that to I'm and I think you can actually do that so if you go to the dictionary right I'm just going to say I'm at to dictionary and I think this just helps saying like hey this is a this is a word right so just that one time my worst per minute went way up and as you can see I'm already at 66 so I just burned like 40 right there I want to try talking to it like an actual AI assistant because I believe that's a feature as well so let's go ahead and say hey Bob uh yes I totally agree with what you just sent me and I think we should talk about it over coffee next week so how does Tuesday at 300 p.m. sound and by the way whisper that's going to be a text message so can you make sure it looks like a text message so I want to see if it's going to act like Ai and understand that last part that I was trying to tell it instructions rather than dictate that so let's go ahead and see what it gives me here hey Bob yes I totally agree with what you just sent me whisper that's going to be a text message so can you make sure it looks like a text message so it did not understand that I was trying to tell it something and maybe that's on Me Maybe I need to do something different I do like how this is formatted like it it it looks and by the way whisper that's going to be a text message it's using a lot of commas so like it clearly is understanding what I'm trying to say and doing that so I I'll just give one last example here and say okay this is going to be my last example and um yeah I'm uh I'm super excited about this I don't know about you but uh this has been a long time coming and I'm just excited so I tried doing some inflections in my voice there to see if it's going to use exclamation points so let's see what that turns out as okay this is going to be my last example and yeah I'm super excited about this no exclamation point I don't know about you but this has been a long time coming and I'm just excited no exclamation points that's kind of a bummer but that's okay it still came out and it still looks very formatted that's the first trial of whisper I will say the one thing that whisper is good at is that it's always connected to the internet which actually is a pro and con right so it's connected to the internet so you can use it on like Google Docs or basically anywhere it's always connected and it's using a a language model connected to the cloud rather than running locally on your computer but there is a little bit of controversy surrounding whisper so if you Google whisper the second result here is going to be this Reddit thread basically a fair warning about the app a lot of people just aren't happy with uh transparency around how all of this works and basically what they're doing with your data uh It also says this this app uses a lot of your CPU it's using a lot of your computer's power even when it's not being used right so even when you're not using it to dictate it's still using a lot of power in the background a lot of people are just worried about sort of the data collection because it is sending it over the internet right so it's it's uh it's running the models through the cloud rather than locally on your computer so there's just a bit of concern about like security and data usage so if that freaks you out whisper might not be the tool for you so just keep that in mind I won't comment on it because I just don't know enough about you know maybe it's just a misunderstanding there's lots of people on a team and as you know at one company if one person does something wrong it can lead to misunderstanding so do your own research here I enjoy the tool but I do think there's a bit of controversy here that probably needs to be cleared up that is whisper flow and now the next one we have here is super whisper super whisper as you can see I still have uh like 14 minutes left of my Pro usage and it is pretty nice to use but I will say it does feel a lot more complicated than the last one than whisper flow because you do have to go in here and basically choose all your models but if you're like a tech geek you probably like this right you probably like the idea of being able to choose your own model uh they all have like a different speed and accuracy right so like you you sacrifice some stuff for others their Ultra model is a 10 out of 10 it's like NBA 2K getting like the bars there it's like their speed and accuracy is both 10 so why wouldn't you want to use this right unless you don't have the Pro Plan so I think we use this because we have the prop plan yeah text replacement so correct spelling inject links examples calendar link configuration so this is all pretty basic stuff and again this actually does feel like a like a Mac app it's it's not as like clean as the other one but it's pretty easy to use and and toggle around here the AI models is a little bit confusing but everything else is is pretty intuitive and and sort of easy to understand now you can create different modes for like messages and emails and documents and others and I think that takes a little bit of training here let's just say yeah email I'm not going to do all this right now I'm just going to use basically what's out of the box but yeah you can do all of that with super whisper let's go to the same doc we had here let's try out super whisper this one is going to be option spacebar hey there super whisper um I'm just typing this out and making a quick video I just want to I just want you to write this out for me I'm having uh a lot of fun and I think this is going to come out good so I'm not sure if it just picked that up let's see here oh there it is hey there super whisper I'm just trying to I'm just typing this out and making a quick video I just want you to write this out for me I'm having a lot of fun and I think this is going to come out good okay it just did exactly what the other one did so that's a good sign as you notice I do say like um uh like a lot in there and it takes all that out for me right so it's understanding like hey keep it short keep it brief don't don't do all that nonsense now let's try it again and say the exact line that we we did with whisper flow before this hey Bob yes I totally agree with what you just sent me um and I think we should talk about it over coffee next week how does Tuesday at 300 p.m. sound to you now let's see what it says that was pretty quick that's a thing as well it did seem like whisper flow was a little bit slow but this does seem good so hey Bob yes another comma there that this one didn't have I totally agree with what you just sent me and I think we should talk about it over coffee next week how does Tuesday at 3 p.m. sound to you so they started a next sentence with and which I like some people don't think it's correct but I actually like that there uh let's go ahead and and try this again and by the way uh super whisper that's going to be a text message so can you make sure it looks like a text message um that's the last line that I just put there where it begins with hey Bob so no it just dictated it so I was wondering if it would go back to this last one and basically grab that and then turn it into a text message I was trying to give it instructions rather than actual dictation but no that's okay it it did exactly what I said and then let's go ahead and do this one last last one okay this is going to be my last example and yeah I'm I'm super excited about this I don't know about you but this has been a long time coming and I'm just excited okay so again I tried using my tone in that and see if it used any exclamation points but okay this is going to be my last example and yeah I'm super excited about this still no exclamation points so again they're actually pretty similar here and they seem to do pretty much the same thing when it comes to dictation and now last but not least we have mac whisper and out of all three I will say this does seem like the most complicated but there's a good reason for that because Mac whisper has been around for a while and they didn't originally start out necessarily as a dictation tool it can do a lot with like transcribing podcasts or transcribing YouTube videos or recording meetings for you so it does a lot more than just dictation but dictation as you can see it still says it's in in beta here so this is a little bit more of like a complicated app right so if you're just looking to use the dictation part of it and you just want to download something and start using it right away maybe this isn't the the best for you but let's go ahead and give this a try and again we're not upgraded to Pro here which means we don't have access to basically the best models that we could but let's go ahead and we've already gone through all of this actually so we're going to go ahead and close this you do have to manage models so like right now I'm just using the the small one the large V3 Turbo is the recommended one but you have to have a pro account so we do not have that the other thing I will mention is all of the processing is taking place on your laptop here so unlike with whisper flow where it's basically the processing is taking place over the Internet through the cloud this is all happening on your actual device so when you manage models you have to actually download the model onto your device now let's go back to the sheet here let's go ahead and just say the same thing hey there Mac whisper I'm just typing this out and making a quick video um I just want you to write this out for me I'm having a lot of fun and I think this is going to come out good let's see what it did I threw a couple ums in there like I did with the last one so let's see how this turns out hey there Mac whisper I'm just typing this out and making a quick video I just want you to write this out for me I'm having a lot of fun and I think this is going to come so it missed the last ones maybe I took my finger off there it missed come out good but it didn't put a period there so maybe it knew there wasn't like I wasn't done with the end of the sentence I won't knock it completely because that could have been on me let's go ahead and try the next one hey Bob yes I totally agree with what you just sent me and I think we should talk about it over coffee next week how does Tuesday at 300 p.m. sound to you that was quick that was quick and I think that's because it's taking place internally on your computer so hey Bob yes I totally agree with what you just sent me and I think we should talk about it over coffee next week how does Tuesday at 3:00 p.m. sound to you that's all good and now let's try this next one and by the way Mac whisper that's going to be a text message so can you make sure it looks like a text message that's the last line that I put where it begins with hey Bob turn that into a text message so again I'm trying to give it instructions uh like an AI bot so hey by the way Mac whisper that's going to be a text message so can you make sure it looks like a text message that's the last line that I put where it begins with hey Bob turn that into a text message so it did literally what I said and that's fine but let's go to the last line here okay this is going to be my last example and yeah I'm super excited about this I don't know about you but this has been a long time coming coming and I'm just super excited so that'll be good to see I did mess up when I said coming and yeah it got it it didn't get my exclamation point but that's okay none of them did overall as you can see they're all pretty similar and I'm sure there's like certain things that they're better at like a little bit but like they're all pretty similar for what someone like me would use them for right like dictating and making sure that they actually write out what I mean to say for fun let's just do the normal text to speech model from Apple and let's do these same things and throw a couple ums and and stutters in there and see if it gets it as well hey there text of speech I'm making a quick video right now and I just want you to um uh write it out I'm having a lot of fun and I think this is going to come out good I mean that's pretty good that is pretty good it's still going it's honestly not that different in my opinion maybe I'm a total Noob and I'm using this completely different but uh hey there text of speech no comma there I'm making a quick video right now and I just want you to write it out I'm having a lot of fun with this I mean that's pretty good that's pretty good it's better than I thought it was going to be hey Bob yes I totally agree with what you just sent me and I think we should talk about it over coffee next week how does Tuesday at 3 PM sound done that was weird like why did it okay it's still going so it didn't stop when I oh well I had it continuing to go so yeah I'm just not sure okay let's let's go to the next one and by the way text to speech that's going to be a text message so can you make sure it looks like a text message it's exactly the same last one okay this is going to be my last example and yeah I'm super excited about this I don't know about you but this has been a long time coming and I'm just excited so of them got my exclamation point But it pretty much did exactly the same I think the big difference here is if we go ahead and use this on email so now we can put it to the real test and we're on email so let's see how this works so let's start out with whisper flow hey Bob uh hope you're doing well and hope you had a great weekend just wanted to follow up on this thanks Nick so let's see if it understood the context of that I'm writing an email right now and let's see if it formatted it the way that's it hope you're doing well and hope you had a great weekend just want to follow up on this thanks it didn't get where I said Nick at the end but that's okay this is formatted like an email should be formatted now let's go to super whisper hey Bob this is Nick hope you had a great weekend and hope you're doing well just wanted to follow up on this thanks Nick let's see here hey Bob this is Nick hope you had a great weekend and hope you're doing well just wanted to follow up on this thanks Nick it did not do the formatting correctly so I got to say minus one point for sub whisper because that format is not great now I'm sure I could train it but it just right out of the box Apples to Apples it didn't get it let's try Mac whisper right now and I'm not sure this is going to work because I don't know if it works on the internet browser let's see here hey Bob uh just wanted to check in on this hope you had a great weekend and hope you're doing well just wanted to follow up on this thanks Nick okay so it looks like it is working okay hey Bob just want to check in on this hope you had a great weekend hope you're doing well just wanted to follow up on this I said that twice thanks Nick now I got Nick again it's not formatted perfectly for an email so far whisper flow is the only one that got that so let's try this one last time with just normal speech to text and see what we get hey there Bob uh hope you're doing well just wanted to follow up on this thanks Nick okay now you will notice the one difference between the other tools and speech to text is that speech to text shows you what it's writing while it's doing it I kind of like that but you can tell that means that it's basically not reasoning right it's not like taking that and putting in in an llm and trying to understand what you're what you're trying to say it's just writing it as it goes right so it's not thinking about it it thinks a little bit past tense about like wait did that make sense in the actual sentence maybe we should change that word maybe he was trying to say something different and we understood it differently but overall I got to say when it comes to emails whisper flow definitely won that but just overall I don't know I don't think they're that different let me know what you think what one you think is the best if I did something totally wrong and that's the reason why one of them didn't shine but I do think if you can start incorporating these into your workflows you can work a lot faster if you just are talking rather than trying to type because you can just say what you're thinking like no keyboard just talking and you're able to get to the point a lot quicker and respond to people a lot quicker so that's it as always appreciate you guys drop a comment subscribe let me know what you think and peace"

It's great for productivity and team workflows, especially if you don't mind cloud-based processing. It starts free with unlimited use at $12 to $15 month, but does raise some privacy concerns for sensitive use cases. Super Whisper on the other hand is built for privacy first users who want offline transcription powered by Whisper AI. It runs locally on Mac OS. iOS offers clipboard integration, translation, and noise resistant accuracy even in tough audio environments. It's cheaper long-term with a $249 lifetime option, but is Mac only and may lack some polish for iOS users. Final thoughts, go with Whisper Flow if you need cross-platform flexibility, AI formatting, and cloud convenience. Choose Super Whisper if you're on Mac and prioritize offline privacy and raw accuracy."

    "text": "Wispr Flow AI has transformed how I code and communicate. In this review, I break down whether this voice-to-text productivity tool is worth the investment for developers.\n\nAs a developer working in London, I've tested Whisper Flow extensively across coding in Cursor, writing documentation, messaging teammates, and prompting Claude. The results? A genuine boost in productivity that's hard to ignore.\n\nKey Features Covered:\n✅ Three activation methods (click, hold, double-tap function key)\n✅ Automatic filler word removal (no more \"ums\" and \"ahs\")\n✅ Smart correction (\"nine, no wait, ten\" → \"ten\")\n✅ Works globally across all Mac apps\n✅ Text snippets and shortcuts\n✅ Command Mode integration with Perplexity\n✅ Clipboard copy when no input field is active\n\nThe Honest Take:\nWhile Cursor has voice input, I find Whisper Flow handles my New Zealand accent better and works universally across my entire system. The downside? Speaking to your laptop in public spaces can feel awkward, and at £12-15/month, it's an investment.\n\nWorth it for you? Try the 2-week free trial and see how much time you save. For me, it's been a game-changer for documentation, prompting AI, and quick team communication.\n\nPricing: £12-15/month | Free Trial: 2 weeks\n\n#productivitytools  #developertools  #voicetotext  #codingproductivity  #aitools  #macos  #developerproductivity  #techreview  #softwareengineering  #aiproductivitytools  #developerlife  #codingtools  #productivityhacks  #tech",

        "srt": "I wanted to do a video review on Whisper Flow AI. Whisper flow AI is an app that basically takes your voice and changes it into text. Now it does that by basically imitating your keyboard, which is really awesome, and it can help you increase your productivity dramatically. There's a few ways you can trigger whisper flow. The first is you can click it. Now, when you click it, every time you talk, it will basically record what you have to say. When you finish, it will now paste that in as if that was your keyboard input. The next way to trigger it is by holding down the function key. When you hold down the function key after you release it, it will now do the same. The final way to trigger Whisper Flow is by double pressing the function key. Now whenever you speak, it will record. Then pressing the function key again, it will paste. So Whisper Flow will automatically remove unneeded words. So here's an instance of, um, whisper flow showing you, uh, that it removes unneeded words. It's removed all of my ums and ahs Another awesome feature is how you can say, let's schedule an appointment for nine. No, wait ten. If you have a look, it's just said ten instead of nine. Now, I want to show you a couple of the ways that I like to use Whisper Flow. The first is by using Claude to prompt. Can you help me with a YouTube video idea? Then I'll send that as a prompt. The other way I like to use it is by helping me write my documentation. So help me write a conference doc for our app that is calling a serverless architected TypeScript backend. And then from there I like to just prompt it and then edit it as I go. Another way I like to use it is through messaging. I'm not going to show you our messaging app, but I'll say something like, hey, that's been deployed, can you regression test it for me? Thanks. My awesome colleague who's a QA engineer showed me these snippets. They're basically shortcuts. So whenever we say bug report, it'll essentially paste out these words. So. Now, if we come to the page and say bug report, it'll paste out that snippet. A lot of my friends who are developers have showed me that cursor does have a voice input, which is true, but I find it really struggles with my New Zealand accent. The other thing I prefer about Whisper Flow is it isn't specific to an app. It's global on your Mac to any input, which is really great. Another cool thing about it being an app is if you actually talk without an input, it will copy to your clipboard, Another shortcut feature is called Command Mode. Now, if you query something like what is the weather like in London, it'll actually take that query and use it and put it into perplexity. So then now we can see what the weather is. I couldn't recommend Whisper Flow enough. It has truly increased my productivity dramatically. The only downside of Whisper Flow is if you do work in an environment or you are working from home. It is kind of weird to be speaking at your laptop and a lot of people do look at you funny. The pricing for flow is 12 to £15 a month, which I can understand is expensive. For me personally, the amount of productivity it increases is worth it. But if you're on the fence, they do have a two week trial, which I'd recommend checking out. You may as well. It's free."

Whether you're writing, coding, or just trying to take faster notes. Today, I'm putting two of the best head-to-head Whisper Flow and Super Whisper. Which one deserves a spot in your productivity stack? Let's break it down. First up, Whisper Flow. It runs on Mac, Windows, and iOS, so it's got cross-platform fans covered. Honestly, I love how it handles contextaware transcription and real-time punctuation. You get transcripts that just make sense. No endless editing. Plus, it's packed with accessibility features, so it's a solid pick for everyone from busy professionals to content creators. There's a free version to test out, but power users will probably want to upgrade. Now, Super Whisper. This one's Makoas only, but what it lacks in platform support, it makes up for in accuracy. Seriously, it's next level, especially if you pick the Pro or UltraAI models. You don't even need an internet connection. It all happens offline, which gives it a huge advantage for privacy and onthe-go work. Integration with tools like Cursor is a big win for developers and writers who live in their IDE. So, which one's right for you? If you need something that works everywhere with smart formatting and accessibility baked in, Whisper Flow should be your go-to. But if you want top tier accuracy, fully offline transcription, and you're on a Mac, Super Whisper is tough to beat. No matter which you pick, both are leaps ahead of old school dictation. Try them out, see what fits your workflow, and watch your productivity soar. Thanks for tuning in. If you found this helpful, hit subscribe for more tech breakdowns and productivity tips."

        "srt": "Hey guys, I have another video for today regarding some tools you can use to become more efficient in your everyday work. Um, so the first one I want to show off is uh a thing or an app called Whisper Flow which lets you press a shortcut and what you say will become uh text. So you can go to any place where you can put your cursor and write something. you can hold down a shortcut where so that is what I'm doing now and you can see this app is now working and what I say now will become a text so I let go of that uh shortcut and you can see what I'm saying was coming in here very cool right so if you write an email if you uh vibe code do whatever uh this is can be very useful just to show you in another face. I'm pressing the shortcut and everything I'm saying is now becoming text and you can see it's um like the spelling is correct and whatnot and you could also speak a language for example text. So you can see also the Norwegian is correctly grammar and uh yeah it's very nice because we can speak of course much uh faster than we what we can do when we write and another stuff I want to show you. So I've made a auto hotkey script. So I have another video if you want to show want to take a look at what auto hotkey is. But it's a it's um a a scripting language for for Windows that you can use to automate certain stuff. Uh and now for example, let's use a visible flow to get again to make a nice uh email to Greg uh saying, \"Hello, Greg. How are you? I hope you find this email uh very nice and uh can you fix that stuff for me? Okay. So, not very maybe not a very good um email, right? But what I can do now is that I can do alt and uh ctrl a to mark that. And now I can do a shortcut alt and uh l and now I'm going to improve that text. So now I'm sending this text to an AI that is free and I'm getting back a response that is better. Let's use this flow to draft a polite email to Greg. Hello Greg, how are you? I hope this is could fix that issue for me. So this is better, right? And now for example, if I am working with a with chatbt for example and I'm writing a a prompt here uh create a nice website uh about um a house. Okay, so this prompt isn't very good. It's very like broad, right? So I can do the same thing. I can um highlight the text and I can do another shortcut. Ctrl Alt and K. And now I'm going to send this to an AI to improve that uh specific prompt. So now you can see it's much more improved and it's much more detailed specifically what I'm looking for. And now you're going to get much better response, right? this uh website is going to be much more specific to what I am asking for. So, I hope you like that. Um, so to get started with that auto auto hotkey stuff, you first need to install it. It's very simple, small program and I recommend installing the newest one for this site and then go into open router and go to login and then we need an API key. So go to keys and then you create an API key and you just need that to connect to an AI but you can connect to an a free um API or a free model and that is one uh we going to connect to let's click on models and uh there is a gro API that is new right now. So that is what we are going to use. We can search for free and this is the gro for fast free. So we're going to use that and then you can see the this is the model ID and this is the name of it. So now we go into that um we make a hotkey script and this is the script. So and can paste this in the description and right now you just need to paste in your API key right here and uh I just showed you how you can find that. So API keys make a new API key and uh uh uh copy that API key go into um to the the script. So to create a new auto hotkey script, you can just right click and uh click new and then click auto hotkey script. And then you paste in the script and then you go into this and you paste in your API key. And now if you can scroll a bit down uh you can see the different stuff you need to use. So this is the main uh hotkey for um improving the text. And this is now set to controll alt and l. So this is control this is um alt and l. to see what what is what we can uh we can also search for that hotkey v2 symbols and you want um a specific hotkey that is not used for anything else and here you can see the the stuff which is which so control is this symbol and whatnot cool and then you run that uh script script and then you will find it right here. So, this is the one I'm using and now you're able to do what I've been doing. And the Whisper Flow is uh from another web site. So, this is not uh specific to our hotkey, but very cool. And um especially if you're working from home and you want to send some emails and stuff, you can just press the hotkey and then you can like speak what you want to to say and then maybe do another shortcut to improve that text and you can increase your your workflow a lot. So I hope you enjoy that video and I see you in the next one. Okay, bye."

So, let's quickly dive into it. Talking about Whisper Flow, Superflow makes writing fast and natural by turning your voice into clean, well formatted text instantly. It supports multiple language, work across apps, and even understand tones and pronunciation automatically, making it a great pick for creators, writers, and professionals who prefer talking over typing. However, the free plan is quite limited, and the accuracy can drop with background noise or heavy accent. It's also not ideal for public space since it require speaking out loud. But still, if you want a smooth, accurate voice to text experience for everyday writing, Wix Flow is one of the best tools to use. And that's it. Hope find the video helpful. button and subscribe for more [Music]"

It's called Whisper AI. Uh and it allows me to actually talk to my computer. So when everybody's like, \"Oh, Piper, every time I read your comments, I feel like I hear your voice in my head and that your comment is actually you speaking.\" Well, now it actually is. Before I had to use my fingers. Now I have to use only one finger. That one. That's the one I usually use. And I press on this key. Look at this. We're going to do it together. So I have a reply here. This is our my YouTube comment section. Mhm. Hi there. It's been a while since I watched your videos. When your name popped in my notifications. I immediately open your video. Now I can do this with one finger. Hey, it's so great that you've been following me for years. I appreciate all of your love and dedication, and I'm happy that you're following the Happy Submissive podcast. Make sure that you subscribe if you're not subscribed because I go live from Monday to Friday, 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. Release the finger. Look at this. And it corrects all of my mistakes because I'm super dyslexic. And it's my real voice. So now my comments are way better. I can just talk to my computer as if I was talking to you, my amazing fans, and it does everything in there and I can just click reply. Bam. So, if you're one to have read your comments recently and been like, hm, it's funny. Piper doesn't just say like, \"Thanks for the compliment.\" Or she doesn't just like say these things that look like they're written. No, no, no. Now it's really engaging. I can engage with you. And why are you living in a dark ages? Well, the thing is I know that some people actually have tried to activate the dictation on their computer and I tried this on my Mac actually a few times and it's not good. Uhuh. Uh uh I understand that for the visually impaired like I mean it's better than nothing but since whisper.ai is an AI, it actually like thinks about everything you just said and then it mashes it up in a way that it conveys what you're trying to say. And so if you make a little mistake, if you uh you want to do point by point, it all does these things for you. And this is not sponsored, but if you want to encourage me, I have put the link right down there. Yeah. For my uh my my link. That way I get a month for free. Mhm. Every time you join. And quite frankly, if you work uh from home or anywhere, like this has saved me so much time. Look at this. Uh-huh. It's been 11 weeks and I do 163 words per minute. I'm in the top one of all users. That does not impress me at all. I'm at the top one of a lot of things. Uh, even on a whiff. Okay. But total work dictated. It says you've written one complete book in only 11 weeks. You know how long it took me to write my book? Yeah, my book. Why submissive women are happier? That is 82,000 words. It took me a year and a half. Imagine that. I should have just dictated it and it would have been done in like maybe eight weeks. That's like two months. It's crazy, right? So, right here, right now, you can actually go on Whisper. I have the link there. Just click that link. Mhm. And go and buy it, try it, do whatever you want with it. Actually, it's free for the first few words. But if you take my link and then after that you actually join, I get a month free. So, every time I'm talking for a whole entire month, I'm going to think about you. Isn't it great? I'm Piper Blush and I'm everywhere. You don't believe me? Just Google me or go join the podcast Happy Submissive wherever you listen to your podcasts."

Still typing emails? Still pecking at your keyboard like a confused chicken? Today's tool? Whisper flow. And listen close because I'm only going to say this once before my bottle gets warm. Whisper flow is speech to text, but like not your grandma's clunky dictation tool from 1998. No glitches, no ducking typos, just smooth, fast, real time transcription that actually understands you. You speak, it types. You mumble, it types. You rant while pacing in your crocs, it still types. Capiche, and you know what's wild, it's smart enough to format, add punctuation, even summarize your voice ramble like a tiny therapist. You talk for 5 minutes. Uh, Whisper Flow gives you the tweet, the blog, and the memo. What more do you want? A foot massage? Still taking notes manually in meetings? Still typing podcast scripts like it's 2006? Still pretending you'll transcribe that interview yourself? Grow up. Whisper Flow is already running circles around you. And guess who found it first? I leader Edge, baby. We catalog these tools so you don't embarrass yourself trying to figure it out while the rest of us are already auto summarizing our lives. So stop typing, stop whispering, and let Whisper Flow do the work so your precious fingers can get back to scrolling Tik Tok in peace. All right, I'm out. Uh, my nap is in 12 minutes and some moment still hasn't worn my oat milk. Mic drop. Pacifier slam. Play me out. Luigi out."

        "srt": "I recently started using Whisper Flow along with the linear MCP and um it was so fun that I thought I'd like record a quick tutorial on how we do development here at Waldium. So um just like sit with me while I write code for a second. Um hey um I want to create like a new bulk postcreation tab in my post actions. Can you just create a quick linear task for me scoping this out? So, what I did there was I used the whisper flow to like speak my prompt into my computer and um you can see that linear uh MCP is hooked up here. So, it's going through and like looking at like my like linear board of like you know like which tasks there are and um like you know sometimes I use like plan mode in cursor which is like really good. Um it's usually not like like something I can like oneshot but um I was copy pasting it into obsidian before but now with this integration it's pretty easy to edit tasks directly in linear. So, okay, like it's already created this. Now, if I go here, let's see. Um, 280. Um, can you just assign it to Amria? So, it's actually like pretty good. Um, I think sometimes if you have like a pre-existing task that's um like has the right metadata already, it's like pretty good at doing this. Um, cool. So, it's already created the task for me. Let's see if it shows up. Ah, there it is. Like implement bulk post creation. And it's like done some work. Like it's already figured out that part of this is implemented already and it's uh scoped this out for me. So now I can just say awesome the task looks pretty good. Can you just like implement it for me? Um and go like step by step. So I have been using composer one um a bit but I actually generally like prefer set 4.5 even though it's it's expensive. It saves a lot of time because there's less going back and forth with with cursor. It just like tends to tends to do better. But I think composer is um actually like pretty fast. Um I I like it. Um I like it more than I thought I would. Um so the other like new thing that's been saving me a lot of time recently is like on agent mode um in cursor there's like a create PR button which is like pretty good. But um I actually uh generally um I generally uh like to use like cursor to create the PR. So this is hooked up with the GitHub CLI. The reason is it like populates the PR description and all of that uh for me uh pretty pretty automatically. Um we also use like Mesa for doing some of our code reviews um automatically with AI. Um and that also generates like descriptions but it takes a little bit of time and that happens after the PR is created rather than during this time period. So this is you can see it's actually pretty long running and I have like on localhost this like WDM app like running right here and so I can see that it's actually created this bulk create like tab like for me which is uh pretty cool. Um, so let me just stop this right here and I'll give it another command. Say, \"Hey, this looks good. Can you create a PR for me with all of the unstaged changes?\" And just give it like a really descriptive uh name and uh yeah, just like create the PR. So, I I really like Whisper because uh you know, I'm a really fast typer, but this uh does a good job of transcribing uh intent and uh capturing like capturing the point of what I'm trying to say in in fewer words. Um sweet. So, uh, generally, um, you know, this is a very unpopular opinion, but I actually really quite like, um, GitHub Desktop because it like helps me just like review the code that gets generated quickly. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep using it as much though because, um, there is like a review functionality now built into the new cursor, which is which is awesome. So you can see here that it's like going through and actually like adding all my um adding all my uh changes and it actually like explains like which linear task it's like closing. And now the branch is actually pushed but I want it to generate a PR for me. I did I did prompt it to create a PR. So, let's see how good of a job it does with this. Awesome. So, you can see here that it's uh also created the PR. So, let's go to this link right here and see see what it's created. Um, so you can see everything's like populated here. And this is when um like we we use like Mesa to start doing like code review. I've also been playing around with like the co-pilot reviews and using chatpt codecs but um as this like completes uh this will like usually like dump some code review comments for me and try to rewrite the description takes a few minutes to run but it definitely makes that review process also like a lot faster. Um so hopefully this is like an interesting window into how we do development uh product development with AI at um uh at at volume."

This is day one of me recommending AI tools and this is also day one of my journey of me trying to become a AI master or a AI generalist. In this video I'm going to be recommending you one app. So for today's video the app is whisper flow. Now if anyone wants the spelling so that they can go type it up in um Google the spelling is W I S P R F L O W although the spelling does not make sense that is the spelling of the app. Now let me get Now let me get you started on the app. So this how the app works is you press control + windows on your laptop and while pressing these two buttons whatever you speak it's going to type it down into let's say your word document or your Google document or whatever application you're working on. So it saves a lot of time. And for those who are who are going to ask is it for free or does it cost money? Of course it does have a subscription but you can also use the free version. So let me tell you the free version and the free plan. So basically in the free plan you can speak up to 2,000 words per week. Now I feel like that is enough. So I did not get the pro plan. But in the pro plan you can get you can write like almost unlimited words per week. Don't think it's unlimited but almost. So yeah, I think it's a pretty good deal. And you don't always have to buy the pro version of a app. Even the free version works good for me. So, I use a free version. Now, now you're going to say this is cheating, but I am currently using the pro version cuz I got a free trial of 2 weeks, but after this 2 weeks, I'm most likely going to be using a normal free version. So, don't um give me hate comments in the Yeah, don't give me hate comments. By the way, please make sure to like, subscribe, and to comment. Comment anything you want. If you have any doubts, just ask it. I'm always open. I will answer all your doubts. Now, let me like just show you the app. So, as you can see, this is the app. And then, let me show you a demo. Let me open world once. Just wait a minute. A minute, please. Okay. It's loading. Okay, I have open word now. Yep. One second, please. What just is Oh my god. Yep. Am I going to do this crash? Okay. So, yeah, my world has finally loaded. So, now let me like give you a demo. What I'm going to do is I'm going to press control plus Windows. Okay. and then it's going to start typing. I'm not going to be pressing anything else. Um, what I'm going to be writing is most likely a description on my channel. Hello everyone. Welcome back to my channel on AI. In this video, I'm going to be talking about the app Whisper Flow. This is my first video. If you do not count my introduction, I highly recommend you to watch my introduction and please make sure to like, subscribe and comment. What just happened? Okay. So now as you see over here what I did is I did not press I did not type anything. I just press control + Windows and it has automatically written this. Hello everyone. Welcome back to my channel on AI. In this video I'm going to be talking about the app Whisper Flow. This is my first video. So if you do not count my introduction, I highly recommend you to watch my introduction. Please make sure to like, subscribe, and comment. So yeah, it got it. Um, thanks for watching and please make sure to like, subscribe, and comment. But no pressure. So high you go and you have one pretty cool AI app that you can use to make your work easier and faster. Thank you."

It's free for the first 2,000 words, but if you do sign up using my referral link, you get a $15 credit once you get to need the paid version. I got the paid version before I've been using it for a week. Just to give an example, if I'm drafting an email and I want to send it to myself, say I just hold to control and alt in my case, but two keys down. Sheamusbaldius.com.au and it's worked out that connected my proper email there. And then I'll just click in subject. Hold my two keys down again. Test email to Fred. And then again in the next box, dear Fred, blah blah blah blah blah. And I can also say this doesn't always work but say one do something two do something else three do yet another thing and quite often yes it'll format it correctly the way I wanted it. Another thing you can do uh in chat GPT or any of those tools, ask it anything. Please find all references to whisper flow uh on the net and then click that to see it. And I think now so that's doing that. And of course, the other thing you can do is have any notepad item note to myself about the main things I need to do today. I need to do these in order. One, a thing. Two, brush my teeth. Three, comb my beard. So, you can see it's actually put a colon sent a colon at the end of that and listed the things that I need to do. It's exceedingly clever and does save you a huge amount of time. I can highly recommend it once you get used to it. You just use it all the time. There's some other things you can do. You can add words into a dictionary. You can do it with a whole lot of things. Occasionally, it will not remember will not record what you said. So, you got a little um icon down the bottom of your screen and you can go to home. It lists all the things you've done. So, if it doesn't go in, you just click that and then back in here and do that again. So, it's it's amazingly clever. And sometimes when words that you use that are not clear to it, it you can add them in here. So that's quite good particularly for place names or people's names and it will remember what you've added there. Okay. Thank you."

        "srt": "Whisperflow versus Aqua. Whisperflow positions itself as a highly visual AI argument task management tools that ideal for creators, knowledge workers, and teams who want a more fluid, creative workspace. Its strength lies in intuitive UI, modular blocks, and seamless integration of brainstorming with executive pipelines. Perfect for users who taggle between ideiation and delivery. In contrast, Aqua leans heavily towards structure automation and enterprise label escapability. It offers more robust role based triggers, cross app workflows and supports IT governance feature make it better fit for operations teams such as companies or even developers seeking custom workflows beyond basic task management where whisper flows shines in users experience and visual flexibility. Aqua compensate with deep automation versions control and IPI richness. From a pricing perspective, Aqua tends to be more expensive but justifiable. So for enterprise use cases, Whisper Flow meanwhile is competitively priced for solopreneurs and small teams. In today's saturated productivity market, Whisperflow and Aqua are two emerging platforms that aim to redefine how individuals teams manage their workflows, but they do so much fundamentally different philosophy. Whisperflow is designed with a modern creative in mind, blending task management and ideiation and realtime collaboration into a highly visual flexibility interface. It borrows designed elements from whiteboards, apps, flowcharts, and note takingaking tools like notions all wrapped into one slick experience. Its modular card system, AI assisted task suggestion, and intuitive drag and drop layout make it incredibly easy to use even users unfamiliar with traditional project management tools. It's cater well to content creators, marketing teams, freelancers, and even students who need to think visually and move seamlessly between task and brainstorming. By contrast, Aqua takes more structured enterprisegrade approach. It's a powerful house when it comes to automation, system integration, and operations management. Focusing on optimizing complex process rather than free form creativity, Aqua supports API integrations with CRM platforms, email pipelines, analytic tools, and internal dashboards, making it ideal for software teams. midsize businesses and operations management who need repeatable systems and conditional workflows that scale. Unlike whisper flow which is invites exploration and degree of controlled chaas aqua demands clarity each automation trigger and workflow is meant to serve masurable outcomes. Another big difference lies is customizations versus governance. Whisper flow is built for personalization. Users can choose themes, structure boards in unconventional ways and insert media, task, link or even creative assets directly into their workflow. You can go from writing a blog post to planning a launch sequence in canvas which is huge plus for solo users or startup teams. While Aqua however excels in governance security and reliability offering versions control, user permission layers, audit trails and error handling across largecale automations. This make Aqua better choice for high compliance environments or cross department system where accountability and consistency matter. In terms of performance, Whisper Flow feels lighter and more nibble. It opens fast, syncs instantly across devices, and doesn't overwhelm you with menus or tactical options. Aqua is heavier, more like a command center. And while that means a steeper learning curve, it also means far greater D and control. If you want to set up a multiple steps process that pulls data from Stripe, updates Google Sheets, sends conditional Slacks alerts, and then notifies your CRM. Aqua does that with procession. From a pricing standpoint, Whisper Flow is clearly aimed at the solo to small team segment, offering generous free tiers and affordable monthly upgrades. Aqualins enterprise often requiring demos annual contracts are highly upfront investment. But again it delivers on up time integrations and automateions power that justify its cost. Users community also reflect these differences. Whisperflow has an engaged user base made up of creative and builders sharing templates and aesthetic setups while Aqua forums and support channel are more technical focused on troubleshooting and workflow logic. In an honest sidebyside comparison, it boils down to this. If you are a creative professional, startup team or visual thinker who need allin-one space to ide executive without sacrificing beauty or flexibility then whisperflow is the more inspiring and enjoyable platform. But if you are managing scalable operations, automationheavy workflow or need deep integration with business tools, Aqua is more powerful, reliable and long-term solution. Each tools win its own arena and in many ways they don't complete, they complement choicing the right one depends not just on what you are building but how you think and work. inclusion. The choice between Whisper Flow and Aqua ultimately hinge on whether you are prioritizing creative edibility or systematic presence in your workflow. Whisper Pro feels like the natural extension of your thoughts, dynamic, open-ended and beautiful visual. It empowers users to think, plan, and act in the same space without rigged structure that often hinders creative momentum. It's perfect for content teams, entrepreneur, designers, and even educator who prefer free form expression blended with productivity. On the other hand, Aqua isn't about creative freedom. It's about creating order at scale. It's engineered for environments where process integrity, repeatability, and multi-layer automation are not negotiable. Aqua strength lies is transforming fragmented operations into cohesive pipelines enabling organization to scale without losing control. They both represent different ends of the productivity spectrum. Whisper float thrives in organized chaos while Aqua drives in or trusted procession. For higher breed dreams using both can even make sense. I date and map strategy is in whisper. Then deploying it operationally in Aqua. Either way both tools are excellent but for different minds, different missions and different measures of success. So that's it."

        "srt": "Welcome to Automation Hunter, the podcast for entrepreneurs and businesses ready to scale smarter. In this series, Apps, Hacks, and Bounties, your host, Will Christensen, dives into gamechanging tools and strategies alongside special guests, sharing insights to boost productivity and solve real business challenges. Ready to innovate? Let's dive in. Welcome everyone to this episode of Automation Hunter. I'm your host, Will Christensen, and I have Kyle Becker here. For those of you who have been watching, you know, Kyle was already on the show just about a month ago. Um, and we're diving in here with him to get to some of the apps, hacks, and bounties. We had a fantastic discussion on AI. Um, and you know, looked at all sorts of different trends. Um, he's an AI consultant. So, there's there's some cool things there to discuss. Um, and today we want to focus on the apps, hacks, and bounties that Kyle has come across. Um, but before we go any further, Kyle, just give a give us a 30 second rundown of why would someone want to hear from you in terms of apps, hacks, and bounties. Why would someone want to hear from me? Okay. um we get pretty close to the issues that our clients are facing. You know, before we recommend any solution, we do a lot of listening and uncovering and pulling back, you know, the layers of the onion. Um and then whatever we recommend in terms of apps and hacks, we ensure that it's executable by integrating oftentimes with with our client, right? So instead of um you know recommending uh certain AI solutions that conceptually or theoretically make sense you know we'll be there to implement them as well right and therefore you know you got you got to execute uh the best you know I'm all about planning I love the plan um I think planning is essential um but you got to have a good team and a good way to execute right in order for that plan to come to fruition. It's almost like um Edison said that you know invention is about 99 or 1% inspiration 99% presseration. I think I said that right you know so you got to sweat to make it come to life. So yeah, I think that's why people should listen to me if they want to, you know, is I try to um there's this author, Nim Taleb, he wrote The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness and books like that. He hates consultants and and the reason he doesn't like consultants is because uh you know, he describes him as not having skin in the game. He describes economists the same way. It's like you make all these recommendations, you know, but if things go south, you know, you can just wash your hands of it and walk away. Well, I I try to be not be like that, you know, and get personally invested um in in whatever it is we're recommending to our clients. So, Very cool. Very cool. And you have some interesting background um in the military. Is that right? The the Marine Corps, if I remember correctly. Yeah, in the Marine Corps. Yeah. Reconnaissance. Very cool. So, um I love that. So, so diving into apps, hacks, and bounties. Um, right before we started recording, I mentioned an app that I have found that is just mind-numbingly cool. Um, I've talked about it on other episodes, but I wanted to share it with you. It's called Whisper. Um, and it's spelled a little bit differently. Um, it's actually spelled wispr flow.ai. Whisperflow.ai. Um, this app basically makes it so that if you're more of a verbal communicator, you can literally voice type um, anything you want and it actually restructures what you said so that it's actually written understandable. So, it's not perfect from the standpoint of like, you know, it restructures it in the exact way that you would write it, but it makes the sentences intelligible, removes the ums, like it I see. And it does it almost in real time. like I I literally press control and alt on my keyboard. I talk to my computer. I let go of control and alt and all of the sudden um I've got, you know, a a text a little paragraph there um ready to go. So, it's been a fantastic tool game changer for me in terms of being able to speed up my communication in all these asynchronous platforms. So it instead of just a voice recorder that transcribes what you're saying into text, it'll take its time going through it to improve the grammar and remove the filler words. And so does it allow you to change the or select the tone or the uh sense patterns to be more like dosies if you wanted to or something like that. So you do have there's some command pallet stuff where you can go a few steps deeper. I haven't gone that deeply into them yet um to to figure out where it is because it's been sufficient for me just to be able to rapidly communicate because because I prefer voice notes and I love Slack because Slack will transcribe the voice note but then when someone's reading the voice note I don't know about you but voice notes are not always that easy to follow because they include those filler words they string of consciousness. Exactly. It's it's it's much harder to understand and so you miss all the intonation which often removes some of the meaning. This tries to do a good job of essentially restating what you said, but in a grammatically accurate way. Um, I used it this morning to have a two-way conversation with my co-founder, letting her know that I wasn't going to be at a meeting later today that I didn't feel like I'd bring value to it and I I need to focus on some other things. And she wasn't super thrilled about that. And so we were having a back and forth discussion and I was sending her paragraphs of text about why I didn't feel that I that I would, you know, would be the right person to be there. And so she's looking at it and probably being like, \"Holy crap, he's like articulate. This is he's he is really putting out there what he means.\" And I'm sure she probably keyed into it a little bit because there are some things if I say I think in the middle of a sentence, it'll often put that, you know, commas around that and put the I think in there. Mhm. Um, but it did a decent enough job that she was totally she didn't complain about it at all and we were able to have that conversation and I was able to use this instead of these um to make that conversation happen for those of you who are listening on audio. I just uh pointed to my mouth and then jazz hands. Yeah, I brought up my little fingers that that are about the typing. So, so that's essentially what we've discovered is there's a an awesome hack to being able to do that. And you can speak three times faster than you can talk. Um, so pretty powerful that way. You can then you can type. You can speak three times faster than you can type. Is that correct? Okay. Yeah. No, I uh that would be really useful. I mean, my wife and I get along quite well, but not always. So using Whisper Flow to help articulate myself in a in a reasonable persuasive way uh would be useful, but I mean that's maybe a silly example. There's a lot of business application for that especially I've actually done that by the way um with chat GBT. I I've had it pretend to be my wife. Like hey pretend to be my wife. She's mad at me for this. How like let's have the conversation. And so, um, we basically have an open conversation and all of a sudden I'm way more ready for the conversation with her because Chad GBT is actually forced me to think through what I want and need um versus me just vomiting, you know, random strings of consciousness onto her um for what's there. So, yeah, I've done that as well. So that makes me wonder um you know when I'm using these AI tools I never know how much I'm learning from them you know in terms of it shows you examples on how to speak as you mentioned on how to code you know on how to write uh stories what else you know all sorts of things to use job applications and job descriptions and things of that nature. Um, and so, oh, you're like, you know, you'll read this, you're like, \"Oh, that's a great idea.\" Okay, now I know how to code this or that, but then the trade-off, and this is what I'm not too sure about, is how much do I atrophy in those areas, you know, just like with Google Maps, you know, Google Maps like shows you new routes and you learn new ways to get places, but at the same time, you you would be lost without it. You know, you fail to commit things to memory because you become dependent on it for some of those different pieces. My experience has been that you can actually use AI to challenge your learning um and to force you to learn and go deeper and farther. And so it in a lot of ways um I saw a clip of Steve Jobs um and he was describing the computer to somebody who had never heard of a computer and he said I mean you can walk to church and continue to walk to church the way you've always done it or you can get on the bicycle and yes it it could be slightly more dangerous and yes it's going to take some time to learn to ride that bicycle but eventually once you've learned it it now is twice as fast or three times times as fast or 10 times as fast to get to church or or to wherever you're going. He he said the computer is no different. The computer is a bicycle for the human mind, you know, you know, and he just described it as a tool to go in there. So, do you atrophy because you stopped walking? I don't think so. I think you just learn to work different muscles because now there's a new tool to use to upgrade your skill set. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a great point. I think there's a lot of nuance we could dive into with that. You know, I I think inherent in technology advancements, other areas always seem to atrophy. So, the trick I I believe is just to be aware of where you're starting of what muscles start um start to get weak. And just like you would go to the gym, because we're no longer, you know, hunter gatherers or farmers or whatever, just as you would go to the gym to stay in shape, you know, you should, you know, take deliberate steps to, you know, identify, you know, what this technology is causing you to be bad at and then go to the gym, you know, maybe maybe not use Google Maps. Hold on though. Hold on though. Like going back to the bicycle analogy. Yeah. Just because I started riding a bike everywhere doesn't mean I forgot how to walk or Yeah. Right. So, so, so I think a and and AI is interesting because, you know, is it taking away from our ability to critically think or or is it taking away from our ability to problem solve or is it taking away and in my mind just because I'm using a tool to do the task faster doesn't mean I'm not still exercising the muscles. Um, and so I don't I haven't found any areas that I'm atrophying in yet. Um, and I if if anything, I've decided to push myself farther to use AI for more. Yeah. So, so like I am not great at going to the grocery store and remembering all the things that need to be picked up. I'm just It's not If you give me more than three things, the first thing falls off the list. Like I have ADHD. Like that's just part of me. Yeah. Six months ago, I went into the grocery store and I fed the text message that my wife sent to me of all the things that I needed. I gave it to ChatGBT and then I turned on voice mode and I used these, my open ear headphones and I had a personal assistant and I said, \"Okay, look through that list. What should I go get first?\" Knowing that milk is in the back of the store and and it said, \"Okay, the first things on your list, I would go get milk because milk is on your list. And you also have sour cream and eggs, which are often by the milk. So, so try try those first. And then it just sits and waits for you to talk back to it. And then you say, \"Okay, I've got the milk. I got the eggs. I got the sour cream.\" It's like, \"Cool. The next thing on your list is snacks for the kids.\" And so I did this again literally on Saturday. Um, and I was at the grocery store and I slapped these on and and it it what I found is that in the past it actually has had a hard time like it it would hallucinate and forget something on the list. But I found that just like a human you can be like, \"Okay, now the very beginning of our conversation, what were the initial things I told you? Walk me through the entire list again.\" And it's gotten good enough now that it was solid. It got every single thing on the list. It walked me through, you know, where to get there. There were some moments like I I looked up which aisle something was on and I told it to remember it's on A10 and it was like oh got it on aisle 8. I was like no it's on A10. And it was like got it. It's on aisle 8. I was like okay obviously the word a n like that that that sounds a lot like and so I said it is on a as in apple. There you go. 10. Yeah. And it was like oh A10. Got it. So like you do have to, you know, have have the direct conversation with it. But but it it enhanced my grocery store experience because generally that place is pretty overwhelming for me because there's so much input in terms of all the different things that are out there and I don't have anything that keeps me on task. Well, if I've got a little, you know, bug in my ear being like, \"Hey, this is what you're supposed to go pick up next.\" All of a sudden, I'm engaged and I I can go through the grocery store and connect those dots. So for me, sorry, go ahead. my grocery store muscle is way better. Oh, there you go. Yeah. And just because there's some issues with the AI, you know, you want to throw the baby out with the bath water, right? It's still the the you know, the net value of it is is much greater than uh than not having it at all, right? So, yeah, a lot of people who are um skeptical of AI, my daughter hates AI because she's an artist. Um but uh you know, the people who are skeptical of AI will, you know, point at little things and make a mountain out of a molehill. I' I've noticed. Um, but I don't think I think you're using AI the right way and you're identifying all these use cases. And that's what I love about the ubiquity of of AI how it currently is. Everyone's using it and finding new use cases that that aren't even sort of advertised or prescribed by AI developers. People are just finding new ways of of using it. There's this one uh author I remember he says bring AI to the party. Like you know try to AI use AI everywhere you can. It won't always work but you know but at least you know its capabilities. Yeah. and and you also know its limitations and those turn out to be great. Um, so speaking to your daughter and and artists, one of the things that I've discovered is that AI, if you're in an industry, um, writing art, um, data entry, if you're in one of those spaces where AI is just shining, like, wow, AI does a good job. Like, it it didn't used to be able to be like, oh, make me a poster that says X, Y, or Z. Um, I can tell you that at this current point in time, it is actually really good at making posters and and actually s looking sounding, you know, all of the above real. Yeah. I've been super impressed with what I've seen um as far as as that stuff goes. And so for those individuals that are in that field, my challenge to you is go use AI to make yourself and the art you produce better, faster, all the above. So like you can just ignore it and be angry that it exists. That's how you get replaced. That's how you never get to become the artist you want to become. If you use it as an intern who does everything you ask in terms of concepts and make me, you know, a character that looks like this and does that. Oh, I don't like that. Change this about them. Like, okay, that's the direction I want to go. Now, teach me how to draw that. Like, like in it in its full, you know, whatever is there. like anything in life you can you can do this sort of challenging situation with to to figure out where to go. But but that's what I would say to people who are skeptical or frustrated because they they feel like it's just stealing like the other piece of it is this the world hasn't caught up with the copyright problem with AI. Yeah. like like the the the blatant use of other people's material um to create the AI because all of a sudden once you've got you know hundreds of thousands of inputs like how do you how do you credit anyone? There will come a day soon, I believe, within the next year or two, where the AI, the guys who are raking in the cash on the the computing power and everything, you know, the the the stuff that's out there, they're going to have to start paying creators. So, there's going to become a way that you as an artist can contribute your work to an LLM and then you get paid just like Spotify every time the AI references it. Like, like we're going to get to a place where the creators get compensated. We just haven't figured out like like I hope so. There's so many open source models though that are already trained on on on data. You know, it's kind of no going back from that or it's that you know what would you say like the cat's out of the bag I think in a lot of cases. I hope you're right. I mean as you mentioned Spotify was able to figure out a model where creatives get compensated. What I what I tell I think that's a good point uh will that you know well you know if kind of you can't beat them almost join them or use it to challenge yourself. So, this is a movie poster I made for myself when I like on my birthday. I literally, you know, 39 years old, starring Will Christensen. April 12th, Saturday at 2 p.m. 39 years old is great. Cornelius, you know, whatever. Like, I made this using AI. I fed it a picture of me. I told it to make me a cartoon version of myself. Um, and spit it out. And then I put in there and said, \"For my birthday today, if you're seeing this on your feed, I want you to tell me what movie is most most describes the way we met or most describes you or me, you know, and and and put it out there.\" And people replied to it. But I wanted something that was eye-catching. This took me probably 30 minutes to to go back and forth with AI enough to get it out there. I didn't edit it at all. Like there's there's like those the words that are on that page. Every last bit of it you can see. Now the thing that I thought was fascinating is the only part of it down here at the PG rating. The the PG rating parental colladop. There's also your lanyard. Your lanyard around your neck has got some weird. Yes. Lanyard around my neck is also funky lettering. Um but everything else that I actually cared about worked great. Right. So, so for someone like your daughter, um, who is is trying to make an being an artist a profession, I would say I've just given you the most magical paintbrush of all time. Use those artist skills to get that paintbrush to paint for you and and and grow in in where you're going. That's where I would go. That's what I would push on to to dig in in that way. So cubic zirconia didn't make the diamond industry go away, right? People still want authentic diamonds, even though what you can do with cubic zirconia is much more versatile, pretty amazing, right? People still pay top dollar for authentic diamonds that are pulled out of a mine or wherever. Um I think that I think that's what's going to happen to creatives a lot, you know, because people do feel a sense of um uh what's the word? disingen, you know, like it's being disingenuous or inauthentic when when they're presented with something that is, you know, they were led to believe that this came from someone directly, but it was also by far my biggest word of advice for anybody who's getting into one of those careers is be honest about where it came from. So, if you're going to use it as inspiration, if you're going to, you know, dig in that way, like dressing it up to be the real thing is the same as it's fraudulent, right? If somebody were to try to sell you a cubit zirconium ring as a real diamond ring and you found out, you could go press charges, right? That's fraud. Um, so yeah, so if you're able to verify whatever artwork you made is 100% human, you know, I I think uh that's the way creatives is a big way they're going to get compensated. That's meaningful to people. If creatives will use AI to further their create, like take the parts of the creative journey that are difficult and annoying, like the concept art where you're like just sketching it out to see where that goes, let it do some of that concept art for you so that then you can decide, okay, this is what I really want to to create. Um yeah, I I it's just a a fascinating world um to kind of see where all of that goes. Um awesome. Well, let's dive in. Apps, hacks, or bounties. What app would you like to highlight on our podcast today? Uh, N8. N8.com. It is an intelligent workflow automation tool. Okay. It's It's like Zapier. Um, okay. I don't I don't have a lot of experience in Zapier, but with N8. I have a thousand hours of experience in Zapier. So, you're thousand hours. Wow. Yeah. So, so, so you're talking to a Zapier certified expert. Tell me, what is it about N8N? Um, and I have installed it. I've messed around with a little bit. Yeah. Um I'm curious, what is it about Nan that you're just like, \"Oh my gosh, people need to know about this.\" Well, what blew me away, and I'm don't know if Zapier has this yet. You probably you obviously would know better than I would, but they have um you know, it's a workflow automation tool, right? So, if you know our audiences don't know, what it allows you to do is take certain processes that you do manually, right? And you can um automate them by connecting different nodes together, right? So maybe an example is you have to fill out um you know an expense report or something you know and that's pulled all the data you need from that expense report is pulled from different documents that are stored in different um folder structures different SharePoint sites and then once you get that expense report together you need to send out an email to a variety of different uh departments you know uh explaining explaining what's in it and and highlights and so forth. So um I guess that'd be one quick example of a process flow. So what workflow automation tools is they automate that right? You can imagine that you know there's one node one node that pulls in all the data you know from different spreadsheets from different rows and columns right there's a different node that writes that information to the report. There's a different node that uh generates an email and another node that sends out the email and another node that records what you've done. Maybe it updates your uh management software, your CRM or whatever. So that can all be um automated to a large degree. These workflow automation tools are great. Well, what N8 does in addition to that is it has um you can put AI agents in the middle of the workflow, right? That can use reasoning ability. So, these um workflow automation tools, they're rules-based, right? You have to be very explicit. Your syntax has to be spot-on. You know, uh it's rules based. If you put an an AI model in the middle of it, well, then it's not rulebased. what's the term will you go from um uh deterministic to I guess nondeterministic I think there's another word I'm missing there but you know it can use its reasoning ability uh to do a few things it can send it to a different uh substream you know based on the conditions that maybe someone articulates in an email right or you know you can use it to whenever you send out that email your little AI agent can look at all the data and summarize it for you right and put it in a short paragraph or however you prompt engineer This reminds me of Lindy. Lindy is basically Zapier but built AI first. There you go. Zapier is catching up. Um I see them constantly it iterating. Um they do have AI abilities that are built into their platform. They're just not as easy to integrate, but you can easily take input from one side and and I use it all the time. I've got multiple things that come in and say, \"Okay, guess the person's first name based on their email address or or look, you know, Google the email address and find the person's first name.\" All of that's totally possible um inside um inside Zap year. So tell me sorry just one other one other thing I like to mention about uh the a the workflow. So you put you put the AI agent in the middle, but another thing that's special about this node, and I think this is really important, is you can connect it with certain skills and abilities, right? So for example, well, one, you can switch out which AI model you're using from OpenAI to Gemini to cloud or whatever. You know, you can you can select it as long as you have the quota. You just need the API endpoint. So you select the right model you want. And then there's tools, there's uh memory, there's sub uh channels that you can connect to this AI agent in the middle of your workflow to make it more robust, right? So you can enlarge in its context window. You can connect you can use rag retrieval augmented generation. You can connect other knowledge bases to this particular um AI agent. Right? So what what I love about that is at Quality AI, we're we have a big focus on workforce. you know, aligning your your human workforce with your AI workforce. Well, conceptually speaking, this this node in inate is you're taking I I think of it just almost very very similar to your human worker, right? And you're putting it in the middle of the workflow and you're equipping him or her with the tools they need to succ. Yep. Yep. instead of just throwing, you know, chat GPT at something, you know, um you're you're kind of specializing, you know, you're it's almost it's almost like you've taken a custom GPT and put it in the middle of a workflow. That's right. That's exactly what it is, Will. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Um and that's that's kind of what you would do with a person when you hire a person. They're responsible for certain processes and workflows and deliverables, and they need to be equipped with the knowledge and the tools, the SOPs to get things done. And that's that's what I think in does very visually, right? Whereas I'm not I don't come from a coding background. So I like I like visual I like gooey graphical user interface stuff. I love it. I love it. Um I think you've nailed the hack and the bount or excuse me the app and the hack there. I think that's that's an app and a hack. What is your favorite workflow that you're currently using with NAA and they're like wow this just saved me lots of time. Uh I guess the first one that comes to mind is is on our website. We have a helpful little chat agent, right? Um that is can answer questions um just about any question that the viewer would want to know coming to the website. Um again because it has you know all the all the powerpoints and all the word documents that are related to qualia and our lysm framework you know our different consulting frameworks it's trained on all that stuff right and it's also trained on the more customerf facing questions as well like how do you sign up for the e-learning course how do I get a discount things like that it knows how to do it right just like if I picked up the phone and explained it to people so so in that situation I mean I it's funny because four or 5 years ago, um there were people out there who were um like they had a chat um bot that they would let you install and they had their own AI. They weren't calling it AI at the time because that wasn't the term. Um but they had human operators who would jump in when when it got stuck. Yeah. Um, and you would pay per hour for the human operators. And that that was their whole shtick was was I I'm we've got, you know, AI. I I should go look them up again to see what they've created with all of this new AI. Well, um, this was fantastic. You have thrown out some amazing things for our listeners. Um, this was a fantastic episode. We got to wrap it up here. We're we're at the 45 minute mark. So, um, appreciate you, Kyle. It was a fantastic uh, time chatting with you. Yeah, good seeing you again, Will. And thanks for having me on, man. It's a real pleasure. Awesome. That's it for this episode of Automation Hunter. [Music]"

        "srt": "Allow me to introduce you to Whisper Flow. It is a very smart app that writes down notes with your voice. So, for example, let's see how accurate this is. Welcome to my channel. This is Rick Designs and my name is Rick. And today we will be talking about Flow, an AI tool that correctly translates or transcribes every word you say into text. You don't need any keyboard. It's just your voice. Yep. Everywhere you send to text, you don't need any keyboard. It's just your Perfect. You see how accurate this is? This is a testament to flow. When you use your laptop or phone's transcription, it adds unfiltered arms and uh and those things. But with whisper flow, it takes out those things. So, let's have a chat with perplexity or tragicity. I like perplexity when it comes to accurate conversations. So we are going to go with perplexity and let's just see how we can chart a normal chart. Draw a table for stocks on the Ghana stock exchange price changes per month. So January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September. And I want to see MTN, SIC, Access, Total, Cow Bankang, the big the top 10, 15 stocks. Okay, it didn't add the MTN. It got my message. It got my message. The top 15 stocks. So, use AI to filter what you say and pick out the important things. Let's see if um this gets it. They show the percentage but I'm not showing the exact prices. Price changes. Okay. 9.5% is good to see the price change but I want to see the price. So I would like to see the prices not the changes and the percentage. Give me the prices in this table. Let's see how it goes. Not a change in the percentage. Give the price in this table. Yeah. Let's see how perplexity. Yeah. That's good. That's great. Great. Great. create great I use accurate I don't know I trust perplexity for accurate news over chat GPT but I hope that are true um I can check I can cross check to see if the price are true I don't think the price are true total isn't 510 ET is around this price. Standard chart is not this price. Um MTN okay that's September but still I don't think September was 3.76. Um these are not correct. Let me ask GPT or Claude. Let me ask Claude. I like Claude. Let's ask Claude the same question. Oh, let me just say it again with Whisper Flow. Research the Ghanaian Stocks Exchange and give me prices for the stocks that are the most popular each month of the year so far. You see how accurate it is. After this, I'll use the normal mic without whisper flow and I'll show you how it looks. Sorry, I'm going a little bit technical and financial with this, but investing is good for you. So, it's something you can learn while we learn about this great tool called Whisper Flow. Okay, I want a table. Can you put this information in a table for me? I want to see all the stocks on one side, then the month, and then table ending, not table, and then the price at the end of each month. You see, it didn't say that, oh, you know what I mean? and those things just said I want see the one side then the month then the price end each month it didn't say oh um it didn't add those things but if I'm using the normal text it will say those things what I like about claude is that it's the AI is incredible in drawing tables it's so incredible that's better than tragivity that's better than perplexity it will draw an attractive table for view. But you can see I don't really need to show you the You see what I was talking about Claude? Incredible. So 162 billion. These numbers may not be perfectly accurate, but I think this is more accurate than what is um uh what's the name of this? This far more accurate than this. This is terrible. This is not realistic. I don't know why it to that, but they didn't give me month or month. January to October, January, just say January to October and the performance. So this access is around this price. MTN is this price. SIC is around this price. Echo Bank ETI is one is 92 actually. Energy is around this price. Quese are really accurate. October 2025 please visit for. So I think yeah claude has done a better job in getting information but they didn't give it to me month by month. Let me ask you to share can you share month by month instead of just saying key period. So make the table January the price and end of January February price end of February to September. keep you a bit till January person and to September. You see how I even organized my thoughts in a new way. So this is whisper flow for you. Absolutely. Okay. They don't have access to a month by month prices for this. The thing about the Ghana stock exchange the no one offers accurate um details. There is AFS quy but he isn't he's also limited. Let's go to AFS quiz. Look at how the interface of his website is so 1995 like and they're saying the stocks have gone down July to October 15th. Anyway, let's stop the video here. Um we learned a bit about stocks and which stocks are doing well, which stocks are not doing well. Here as you can see the growth from year to date from January to this date the number of stocks the percentages um the Ghana stock is doing very well but this is about whisper flow subscribe to our channel and let's see more ways we can use AI to understand things better ciao y You see that? Incredible."

Whisper flow in the super whisper are both tools built on open AIS which model for speech to test voice detection but they have different strength depending on your use case. When you use whisper flow, you are mainly doing real time detection inside your browser. You want voice commands like com like punctuation and the formatting. You work in Google Docs, notion, Gmail and so forth. But when you use super whisper, you need offline private or bulk transcription. you often transcribe and record audio files or voice notes and with super whisper you can use Mac OS and native applications. So to conclude the best for realtime detection is in browser is whisper flow and the best for offline transcription and privacy is super whisper. So that's all for this video.

        "srt": "So, this you said is the new Sky Scout 2 Whisperer, a brand new drone. >> Yep. >> So, this is actually the plus version. >> Yeah. >> So, the Sky There's a Sky Scout 2 and a Sky Scout 2 Plus. The difference between them is nothing on the outside of the drone how it looks. It's the radio on the inside of the drone. >> Ah, okay. >> So, when you get to plus, then you get the new >> controller. That's a big controller. Yeah. So the the regular Sky Scout 2 will be run with like the blue herink. Let's That's a blue her link over there for the inspired flight. >> Yep. >> So the blue or the black her link will run the Sky Scout 2. There was a Sky Scout one. Everything has backwards and forwards compatible. So I can put all the same payloads on the two that I had on the one. I don't need to change anything or do anything if I change drones. >> It's got a whole new design on their on their uh front uh obstacle avoidance. >> Same within the back here. They got a new design. >> Okay. >> And then they have a have it underneath as well. And they also have a new laser rangefinder. So when you're landing, >> it now knows your your height over over the ground. Yep. >> Nice. >> Um >> we got dual batteries that are probably hot swappable, right? I assume. >> Absolutely. >> The same batteries that were on the one. >> Little bit more powerful than the one. >> Uh more you mean the amount of power they or the time? >> Uh the time is about the same. uh can carry a little bit more in the payload. Not much, but a little bit. But it's got all new redesigned landing gear and all new design controls. They made the whole unit modular. >> Okay. >> So, if I bought this as a Sky Scout 2 >> with a with the other controller, I can then send it back and they can actually upgrade it to this. >> So, uh what's the flight time with these batteries? >> You're going to be right around 30 minutes. >> Okay. You know, they I would say you're going to range from about 28 minutes to about 34 minutes depending on >> what you do. >> Heat, cold, wind, all the above. >> Yeah. And what does the battery cost? >> Battery on those, I believe, for a set of those is like 1,300. Okay. >> So, the batteries are about 650 a piece. >> Yep. >> About the same as everybody else, you know, even the little ones are now $3 $400. >> I know. I know. So the um as a payload for aerial mapping. >> So it's got an interchangeable payload. So I can put any of the uh Sony like the uh they have a Sony 24 megapixel that they they use with the Skyscout. There's the 61 megapixel ILXR1. Uh the Recep ultralight it can carry. And there's also a Rece uh light M2X which has a 24 megapixel camera instead of the 5 megapixel camera. >> Okay. Yeah. So you basically can do the LAR mapping all in one go. >> You can. Nobody does. >> Oh, okay. And the reason for that is when you're doing photoggramometry, you actually want your camera to move, right? It's going to go n it's going to go nater straight down, but it's going to go to the right and go to the left. And you have less passes, quicker flight time. >> Y >> with this this has a fixed camera. It's really the camera on this on the on the ultral light is 5 megapixels. So you're not going to map with it. What you're doing is you're coloring your point cloud with it. >> Yeah. And I and I guess you if you see something in the LAR, you can go to a visual and say, \"Oh, that's what it is.\" So you could technically map with the 24 megapixel camera, but it's it's stationary down. So you have to do more passes, have a tighter overlap, that kind of thing. So most people, like I said, if you really wanted to do photoggramometry, you can buy one of the other cameras and then just swap payloads and do a photoggramometry mission or light. >> So if you uh now I can't. See, this is what I mean. That's why I have to record it, right? Did you tell me the price of the drone itself? >> Price of the drone runs right around 28,000. >> Okay. So that's batteries, controller, the drone, no payload. >> No payload. the uh 24 uh megapixel one. >> 24 megapixel camera, you're going to be about 8 grand. >> Okay. >> Uh the 61 megapixel, you're going to be about 12. >> The Recep light here with with a first year of software and everything is going to run you around 27 26 27 somewhere in there. And then the software after that's about 3,000 a year. Okay. >> So, it's actually one of the lower cost. Reppies um PC Master Pro they call it um is one of the least expensive LAR softwares that you could purchase. uh does a great job. Most of our customers that what this can do for that price handles 85% of our customers. We got 15% and you're going to go to something like the Phoenix LAR over there. Their software is actually based off of >> this same type of software. >> It's just on steroids. It can do way more. And then your your yearly fee on their software is going to be between 7500 and 15 grand depending on all the bells and whistles you get with it. And I think this is your it's got the RTK, right? The lights. >> Full RTK. Uh the light will turn on. It will it will tell you red means you're not ready to fly. Yellow, you're getting GPS, but you're not ready. You know, caution, don't fly yet. When it goes green, you're ready to go. >> Perfect. Perfect. >> Um wow, there's a lot of information cuz we we a lot of us have been like, \"Hey, Whisper, Whistler. Whisper looks like one of the best options out there.\" >> Made in Batesville, Mississippi. Very good company. We've been a dealer with them since January of this year. can't say enough good things about them. Perfect. >> You know, they they when they they're like every other drone company, every drone on the market has issues of some kind. They they take care of them. They take care of their customers. Our our customers come back to Whisper because of the customer service they get from the manufacturer and from us. But, >> you know, they they do what's right if something happens and and and they got to make it right. They've always made it right for us. So, we've been very pleased with them. >> And all right, that's the Okay. Anything else that you as you have a lot of experience looking at some of the other drones on the market. So just as an FYI, I would it was just at ASCL, right, which have the M3 clone. Uh I talked to Flyby Robotics to I talked to Inspire Flight as you were a Yeah, the Inspire Blade. >> Yeah, we're an Inspired Flight dealer as well. >> Yeah. Um if you got to compare these, is it just like, hey, this is the uh the sedan and that's the minivan or what what do you see? So, like it's bigger, but price-wise, they're not that different. >> Uh, no. Once you go to once you go to >> Inspired Flight new controller, which is very similar to this, and the new DJI controller, they're all pretty much the same looking controller. >> Um, Inspired Flight's a little bit pricier than, you know, a thousand or two. >> Uh, the big difference is the Inspired Flight's going to carry a heavier payload. >> Okay. >> So, um, some of the new payloads that are coming >> I know six, right? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. So, the the the big one that's coming down the pipe right now is going to be the new Teladine Echo1. >> Mhm. >> Um it's a completely NDAA compliant LAR that's half a centimeter accuracy. Um and it's around 65,000. The next closest to that for a half a centimeter accuracy, you're looking at probably CHC. They're 120. And then you've got Regal, Phoenix, and some other ones that are $350,000 payloads >> to get you to that half centimeter. Wow. Okay, so this this one's changing. Sky Scouts working out. They came in a little over their spec and weight, so they're right at the max weight for the Sky Scout. So, we're hoping, fingers crossed, that all the testing goes well and you'll be able to run it on that. >> That will be able to lift a lot more than this. >> Yeah, it's about almost done. >> You know, the only difference between that is that this has the the um >> Let me turn this off. >> It's okay. >> Um this has the obstacle avoidance. That doesn't have any. >> Correct. one in my opinion. Um, they now have an RTK unit that you can put on top of that that you probably saw over at their booth. That's going to bring them well more into the photogometry and surveying and mapping market >> cuz surveyors are completely trained in RTK and they're not going to fly a photography mission without it. >> No. And >> so for the last year and a half that we've had that unit out, we've predominantly sold it with either inspection or LAR. Yeah, I could see if you like it because like you don't have to buy such an expensive drone for just inspection. >> Well, but you do if it has to be US. >> Yeah, that's true. >> Okay. And then >> by the way, how how is um >> NDA going to be on the green? It's on the green list. >> Okay. >> So, green list, blue list, NDA. Is this all the same? >> So, >> cuz sometime we get confused like what is one versus the other. >> Okay. So, the biggest thing with with NDAA is that the NDAA there are a new version of it every year. Yes. Okay. So, you kind of got to be there there are a lot of companies in this space that say, \"Oh, this is an NDA compliant drone.\" And you read in the fine print, NDA 2021. >> Ah, okay. >> Not up to >> not 2025. >> No. Gotcha. >> So, the blue list and the green list, in my opinion, the only person that should ever buy a Blue List drone is someone that's doing DoD government work and because they have to. Because while you're flying a true Blue List drone, if you flew it for anything else other than DoD, you're flying illegally because there's no remote ID. Oh, I didn't know that. So, wow. Wow. >> A blue list. Blue list means it's militarybased, which means it cannot have a remote ID. So if the military flies it somewhere where they don't want to know anybody, no one wants no one wants to see them. >> There's no robot ID for it because >> for a drone that's on a blue list or what's the difference between blue and green? >> So again, a blue list is military specs. >> Sorry, blue list is the same as NDA. No, they're all NDA. That's what I was starting to tell you.A NDAA is is the government budget >> for the military. Okay. >> So, the blue list was part of the NDAA that if your drone got blisted, it could be sold to the US military. >> Got it. >> Okay. And again, part of that requirement for blue list is there was no remote ID with it. So if you want it for any other work in the United States, you would have to go out and buy a remote ID that clipped on >> and as soon as you clip it on, it's no longer blue. So then you could uncip it and now it becomes blue list to get out. That's the that's the variation of >> and that's the ridiculousness of it. >> Yeah. >> The green list was brought out by AUVSI. So, AU AUVSI got recognized by the US government as a authoritary >> body um and they brought out their green list which means it's NDAA compliant for that year. So, if you're greenlisted in 2025 like this drone is, you are now NDA compliant for 2025. Okay. >> Thank But again, the if if you if someone says they're NDAA compliant, you got to look, you got to check the number and say cuz it could be 2019, it could be 2020, it could be 2022. >> That's a good point. I did not know that. >> So, >> cuz like for example, the blue hair link over there, that controller >> was NDAA approved in 2020. It is no longer NDAA approved. Good point. >> But because it was NDAA approved in 2020, it's going to get you through most government agencies. >> So again, For the most part, this whole thing is am I am I compliant with the people that I'm flying for? And if they're okay with it, then you're fine. >> Got it. >> But there are a lot of people out there that say, \"Oh, no. You have to have a Blue List drone to fly our our government project inside the city of whatever. It's not a DoD project. You're flying illegally if you bought a blue list drone and did perform their data.\" >> That is amazing. So, and I was just something just hit me. Saudia Nanzu Raptor. Let's say it is rain. Tomorrow my my M3 falls out of the sky, right? I mean, quickly a replacement. What is the price point going to of a Raptor at the moment? >> It's around the same price as the they're not that much different. >> Okay. So, >> the batteries are interchangeable. The RTK hats are interchangeable. >> Yeah. So, >> you're different software. >> Yeah. Because the thing is like price-wise, I think at one time I think they're about 7,000 now, right? Or >> with the T's. >> Oh, yeah. Okay. The regular one. >> The E. >> Yeah. Uh, you're going to be about 6 6,500 off the top of my head. I'd have to go look. >> I'm not holding you. It's more like >> cuz the T's T's are typically going to be more like 8 eight or nine now. Like the M3T, >> the M3E is going to be around six grand. The T is around 8,900. >> Yeah. One of my guys, >> the 4Ts are now around 11. >> An M3 M4E. He just picked one up. He's like, \"Hey, you know what? I I'm just making it up. I want to have, you know, a kind of peace of mind. >> So again, from our from our standpoint, there are some internet companies out there that sell them for dirt cheap. We can't get around the tariffs. There were tariffs on them, so we charge for the tariffs. >> Um, but ours are all true DJI North American drones. Okay? There's companies out there that are selling DJI South American drones in North America. >> I didn't even know there were two flavors, so to say. Multiple. >> There's a European one. There's an Asian one. There's a >> And if you get if you get a a South American drone here, you can fly it, but you have no warranty. >> Even if they say there's a warranty, DJI is going to honor it cuz they're not allowed to sell South American drones in North America. Just like we're not allowed. I can't sell stuff into Mexico or into South America. >> If that happens, DJI calls me and goes, \"Why'd you do this?\" Because wherever it's registered. Well, I really really appreciate your time because you I learned a number of very important things here that I was not even aware of that I didn't"

        "srt": "Well, hey everyone. This is the lowercase B podcast. Thanks for joining us today. Uh, today I had the pleasure of chatting with Tene Kotari, the CEO and co-founder of Whisper AI. TA, thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me here. This is fantastic. Thanks, man. When we were chatting last night, one of the things you talked you were talking about is, you know, you're trying to build magic. What does magic look like to you in software? Magic looks like it's the spark you see in somebody's eyes. It's the it's the slight smile that comes up when they're interacting with something that you've built. And there's one time when I was young with one of the first things that I'd built, which was a voice assistant. Uh this is back in 2010. I remember seeing that expression on people's faces when they used it for the first time. Uh, and I think I've never wanted anything else ever since then. Yeah. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Yeah. I I had that moment when I when I used uh Whisper Flow and that was one of the reasons again why I reached out to you because it just seemed it seemed like from the outset you knew what you wanted to build. Yeah. Yeah. And you did a really good job of getting whatever you let out to to regular users, which is what I got my hands on was really good. How did you kind of understand the need for attention to detail in that uh in that first version uh of Whisper Flow? I think part of it just comes from me personally having an extremely high bar for what I consider to be good. And so for the team inside the company, what that looks like is we just keep iterating and pushing the envelope until we get to some point where we say this is good enough for the world. And at that point it's it's something that creates the delight that feels so natural. And a lot of it comes from so I have a I have a deep background in design as well like over the you can tell over the years and it it started off cuz uh I was building apps in high school and most of my friends who I would build this with used to get busy with exams and and tests and all of that and they would just go MIA. So I was like, \"Okay, I kind of need to take care of this thing myself cuz otherwise I get blocked very often.\" So I taught myself design and the more I taught myself, the more I started noticing the little details that other people put into their softwares and it started to matter till a point where if somebody did something slightly wrong, it was very noticeable. Yeah. Everything from a notification lingering for a second too long, a sound that wasn't perfectly timed when the action happened. A software that just made you feel a little off and that all built up. Never thought these two, like the design and the programming side of it would come this closely together, but it did in in a way with with Whisper uh that looking back it it makes sense, but they were just two separate tangents. I think that design is incredibly underrated both in software and in hardware. If you look at companies like Apple, Apple, what are they fantastic at? They make hardware that's beautiful. Yeah. It's just beautiful. And you don't even need to understand what beauty is, but you know, you want it in your hand. It's that magneticism that that gets you to come back and want to use it more. And I feel the same thing with with Whisper Flow. Like when I use it, I just feel like this is the natural thing to do. I want to do it more and more. Mhm. But what that kind of does for me is it builds a bit of a dependence on that tool. What what do you think about people becoming super dependent on your when you think about someone becoming very dependent on your tool? Yeah. You also inherit with that a lot of responsibility to maintain their trust. Could you talk a bit about the trust of your users and how you you kind of uh embed that in the team and help them understand why you're building what you're building and why it's so important to maintain user trust? Yeah, I think this is something that I probably repeat to every new person who's joining and probably the entire team every single week about the fact that there are a lot of people for whom 90% of everything that they do on their computers is with whisper. Mhm. And this is a tool that is fundamentally driving a massive part of their life. And what that means is we can't we can't up. Like we have to maintain that really high bar for reliability, really high bar for user privacy, really high bar for the experience that we keep delivering to them cuz a really small thing like a hidden latency, losing something that somebody said creates such a big impact in them. And so inside the team, every single person is talking to our users on a weekly basis. I personally talk to 50 or 60 users every single week. And I want to talk to them and I want to I want to understand the pain that they that they feel. I think the one of the uh PMs at linear had a really good way to describe it where you keep asking the user question until the point you feel the level of pain that they do with the feature or the or the issue. And if you can build that across your team, then it gets to that level of empathy where uh you really understand the gravity of what you built. But you've picked an incredibly hard problem. In fact, you know, we talked about earlier, you're trying to convince users to break up with their keyboard. Yeah, a keyboard is a staple and by definition it's an interface that you have to have in order to get the maximum use out of your computer, out of out of most computing environments, your mobile phone and things like that. Why pick such a hard problem? I would say in some ways it's the hardest and also in some ways it's the easiest. And and the reason I say that is what we want to do is fundamentally change human behavior. Like my personal philosophy is life is short. Mhm. Uh you could spend it building random apps and games or build something truly transformational. And even if building something that actually replaces the keyboard has a very low probability of success, that's something worth doing cuz that's something I can, you know, be 40, be talking to my kids and be proud of like I tried to solve this really hard problem and whether it succeeded or failed doesn't matter at that point, but we we made some big shots. So that's the the origin of like why I think this is one of the most important problems to me and we decided to tackle it anyway knowing how hard it was. Now the reason why it's easy is the the insight I had about building engaging software is it's all about building habits at the end of the day. Everything else that you know you hear about trying to gamify it and and so on are substitutes for building true habits and truly fitting into people's workflows where you don't need any of that to draw people in. And if you build a software or if you build any tool that people use that that does one thing that people do a 100 times a day is way more impactful than a software that can do a 100 things that people use once a day which is what more so a Siri for example looks and feels like because if you build this thing you build this habit and then you have a user for life and that makes it easy to scale more to give them more to kind of maintain and retain those users. and as a as a business and product, it's just way more valuable to build software that way, especially if you're hitting at that interface level. When you have a user that's really beginning to embrace flow uh Whisper Flow, sorry, and they start getting a lot of value out of it, what do you see like in their data? What is what is a what does a user who's kind of lifting off look like to you and your team internally? So I look at a user's product journey with Whisperflow is it has three aha moments which is what we define their stage by. The first aha moment comes when they first are onboarding onto the product. We've designed this to happen within the first 30 seconds which is your first dictation. Mhm. You say it, you see it appear immediately and it's perfectly formatted, gets names right. It's nothing like people have ever seen before. And so at that point they're like, \"Oh this is actually good and it works way better than what I was expecting.\" So that's number one, but that's not enough yet. The next thing that happens within the first one to two days is people find what is one thing that they love using Whisper for. For some people like founders or people doing customer support or sales, it's emails. And they're like, I have 200 of these to get through every day. And with Whisper Flow, I do it in 2 hours. instead of four. This is one place where whenever I open my email, I'm going to have Whisper Flow. I'm going to use that for all of it. And so within a couple of days, you see people hook on to one workflow. And in data, it looks like they hit about a couple thousand words. And once they've hit that, it's usually revolving around one to two applications. And we know they've hit the second aha moment, which is, I found a place where this fits into my life. The third aha moment usually happens two to 3 weeks from that point which is when they're in some other application and they get this insight which is why am I still using my keyboard? I love whisper for this one thing. Mhm. And there's no reason why I shouldn't use it in everything else. And that day you see them go from two or three applications to using flow in 20 or 30 applications. And in general, the experience they describe it as is I use my keyboard maybe 10% of the time and I use flow for the other 90%. And once somebody gets into that point, they're essentially a user for life. And what ends up happening is they organically go and they're like, I've never talked about any product online. I've never like shared any product like this with my friends, but this has genuinely changed my life. This has changed how I interact with technology in a way that no other product ever has. And usually about 40% of the users who ever sign up get to phase three. And then those users are our biggest advocates, biggest evangelists, all organic. And has been one of the reasons why why Flow has gotten so viral over the last few months is because of these like 40% people for whom it's it's life-changing. Yeah, it was life-changing for me. And and and like I said earlier, it just it was fascinating to me how much more productive I could be when I was less focused on producing with my fingers what was already in my mind and I just needed to kind of let out. You you mentioned earlier it was zero edits, right? That's your goal is you want someone to be able to work with Whisper Flow, get what they need out, and not have to edit it. Yeah. What does that look like to you and and how close are you to that goal? you know um so this is a metric that we track quite effectively in for example how long does somebody spend after they see what whisper produced and pressing enter which is essentially sending the message or like starting a starting a new thing for people who get to get to that later point that number drops down to half a second they're not even reading what flow writes most of the time and they just press send immediately after cuz that's the level of trust that they've built up. And the more you can hit the zero at it, the bigger that trust gets. And the reason this is important is because this gets to a point where you fundamentally have a voice interface that people trust and they don't need to look at a screen anymore for it. So, it's building towards a truly immersive technology experience that lives in the background. So, you as a person can be a lot more present. Now what that looks like in terms of like right now where we are as a company on that path is if you compare to Apple, Google, OpenAI, Whisper, the zero edit rate is about 5%. So 5% of the messages that they produce are perfect, ready to go. With whisper it's about 90% in Slack and text messages number of zeroedit messages. So 90% of the messages are sent without making a single change. For emails, it's about 60%. People have a more professional tone and such and it varies. Email has a lot more variance than some of these other tools do. And people are more particular about how they sound. So that leads to a huge initiative for us this year, which is how do you make these systems adapt and learn from users the way a lot of other tools do it. For example, like chat GPD is something a lot of people are familiar with. And you do it there by going and adding a long custom prompt to it like this is how I like talk to me in like short brief sentences. Don't go on rambles. D my dad is never going to fill that out. My grandfather's never going to fill that out. That is used by a very small fraction of the entire human population. For most of them, they don't like settings. They don't like configurations. And with Whisper, we want to build it for the mass market. So a lot of what we're building right now is allowing those personalization lines like okay we put something out in your email you make changes to it what can we learn from that so that the next time around flow doesn't make that mistake again from next time around it doesn't make that mistake again till a point where that 60% starts to trend higher and higher because that is going towards our our eventual goal of not just killing the keyboard but also screens on on One of my previous podcasts I was chatting with uh Edward Fraser and one of the things I talked about is uh I was trying to assess how I use the internet today. I think the internet's essentially dead. Why do I think the internet's dead? Because we don't use the open internet that much anymore. We use apps. And as I think more and more about that, what I realize is the next phase of how we learn to use or how we use computers is our interface. Mhm. And I feel like we'll know when we spend a lot more time looking up, you know, looking away from our phones, experiencing the world and seeing, oh, there are things out here. I don't need to divert my attention to this device. This device integrates very cleanly and smoothly. When I think about what I do today, I carry around an incredibly powerful computer in my pocket. Yeah. That whenever I need to use it, I interface with it, like you said, in the most inefficient ways. My fingers drive text in at what like maybe eight bits a second. As fast as like not even not even that. My eyes interpret whatever it can put in front of me but they still have to read it. Like these are the most inefficient mediums to send and receive. How do you see us as people using devices in the in the near future? The way I imagine kind of interaction with technology to really look and feel like is uh it should be something that is as natural to interact with as it is with with other people. It is a system that understands you maybe even better than you understand yourself and it feels so seamless to interact with that it inherently becomes a part of your identity. This is what all of technology is going to move towards in the next few years. And that's what it's going to feel like. And the closest analogy to this is is Jarvis, right, from Iron Man where the the thing that you notice about it is uh some very minute details that most people miss out on. Jarvis is not about the fact that, you know, Tony Stark can talk to it and it gets it, but the fact that Iron Man doesn't have to give that many instructions. Yes. To Jarvis because Jarvis has a deep understanding of Tony. It has a deep memory. It has a deep level of context awareness. And so when we talk about AGI, right, I actually think that's focusing on the wrong problem cuz AGI is purely focusing on can you build a reasoning thing that can work. But the hard problem is how do you give it that level of memory, that level of context awareness and more than anything that level of understanding of a single person. Cuz if you look at Chad GPD right now, right, every single interaction you have with it is completely new. It's a clean slate every time. It's a clean slate every single time. And so this problem that I just talked about hasn't even been touched yet. And so that to us when I think about whisper that is what we're prioritizing. And the way we think about is like yeah reasoning engines are going to be built and people are going to call this thing AGI. But the biggest thing to solve is how do you make them work for people? And the fact that I can say that hey say no to this person and it knows how I for example would say that to all the different people in my life which is very different for every single person that I talk to. But there is no AI system in the world that is even this close to being able to do that. Nor would you trust it. Nor would I trust it. I I think being a representative of a human Yeah. is a very difficult thing and you know chat GPT for example and several of the other uh chatbased tools they have memory but memory isn't context in the way that you were just describing it what what how would you define like for what is what is the context of a human yeah it is I feel so so in times when I have tried to build memory into our systems the one thing I learned it it is very hard to represent that in words. It is very representative in terms of examples and what in just like neuroscience terms you would call episodic memory, right? I like my friend would know or let's take the example of my partner, right? If she was texting on my behalf, she knows how I talk to my mom because she's seen me do that a bunch of times and those things are in her memory. you can't put all of if you try to express all of that in words it's going to be really really hard because there is a lot of context around it that gets missed out as well and so you fundamentally have to think about it in a very different way and I think the way um like people look at rag like retrieval augmented generation where you put in some past messages drop that in the way you look at memory where it saves some short snippets that I might use later on as like facts about you. That is a very rudimentary version of what this could look like. It is like at the point of you know the the first wheel being invented and from that to like actually having a vehicle you can you can drive and there needs to be a lot more work there to actually embed that depth of information about different aspects of a person to be able to do the right thing. I think it's also fascinating because when there's enough context uh or when something or someone has enough context about a person, that person feels understood. Think about whenever you've met a dignitary. I don't know if you've ever met like a government official, like high-ranking uh person or uh someone who has time constraints. What do their handlers typically do? They give them a little note card with a few notes about you and they try to remember your name, where you're from, and they try and they and they try to do something to kind of establish context. How do we know each other? But when there's a power dynamic or there's someone that's important, you kind of are are uncritical of how much they know because you just feel it's nice that they they took time to know you. But when it comes to something that's very very personal, it matters a lot. How much does it know me? Does it understand me? What what are some of the things that that you think are important or that maybe you do now in Whisper Flow that you're going to do to help give that feedback back to the user so that they know they're understood? That's actually a great question. It goes to a lot of what we we think of as the core mission for the company. And what I feel is one of the most important emotions for people to feel is the feeling of being understood. You know, when we see people interact with flow, right, and and say it bugs out for a lot of other software, you'd be like, \"This thing stopped working.\" You would say um oh this the software crashed or I did I did something wrong. When Flo gets something wrong, people started saying Flo didn't understand me. Flo missed what I said. Flost my whatever or like Flo really got the names of the people I care about. And so in people's head, they're already personifying flow, which is a very unique behavior that I hadn't seen happen with most other software that's ever been built out there. And people think of flow as in in terms of like status wise, I would say a bit lower pretty much like your your assistant, um like a secretary, a prodigy, something like that. that is there to help you. And that gets us to okay, if you have if you have an assistant, if you have an intern and you want the person to feel very understood by the intern, you want the person to respect this this this intern uh person, what would they need? And so like the first thing you need for that intern is you need the person to be competent, right? Don't make really stupid mistakes. Second thing you need is you need to make the person feel understood. And so I I'll talk about ways in which we do that. And the third thing is you need to be reliable. And so we're essentially with flow building a human personality because we need to because that's how people perceive it. And essentially it's it's breaking it down and and that gets to every single aspect of flow down to like how does the notification sound, the the content of it, the tone of it as somebody from whom we we want the user to to respect it but also we want to show these different characteristics of flow to that person and ways in which you uh make people feel understood. tood is some small things that you do. For example, learning from your mistakes or learning about user preferences. Not just that, but letting them know about it. So, for example, uh all voice dictation systems get the name of my my brother wrong. And so with Flow, one thing that we built that actually is my maybe my my favorite feature of all time is if I fix a mistake that Flow made, it immediately tells me, \"Hey, added this new word to your dictionary.\" And it's like, \"Oh, cool.\" Like, \"You saw you made a mistake. You saw me fix the mistake.\" And without saying anything else, you're like, \"Got you. I'll take care of I saw it do that.\" Yeah. It's great. Yeah. It even lets you like stop it if it if it if it misunderstood. Yes. It let you stop it. And so it's like a lot of systems have like added this to dictionary and you have to go manually add it. That doesn't feel that special. Some systems like charg like tries to add things to memory by itself. That doesn't feel special. But it's like hey figure out this is important to you. I'm going to tell you that I think this is important to you and give you some control over that as well. That is what then starts to feel really magical and it's a sneak peek of what we're going to be building for the remainder of this year. And you mentioned reliability as well. How important is reliability to you? Because like I mentioned earlier, you picked a very tough position to be in which is the final line between the person and the machine. So how do you talk to your team about reliability and the importance of being available for the user at all times? A lot of it is by example, right? Um, I respond to customer support tickets for a few hours every single week. Talk to the users be on like Slack, all of these different channels. A lot of times I personally go in and jump into these bugs. So that shows to the team that it is an extremely important thing for us to be very receptive of that. If somebody feels a feeling of being frustrated, they feel a feeling of uh of loss because of like they they like spoke their heart out to Flo for 2 minutes and it just lost what they said. Like that is a horrible feeling. No one should have to feel that. Uh those things are prioritized and we communicated to the user like, \"Hey, got this. This just absolutely sucks. I would hate for this to happen to me. I'm going to go fix this right now so this never happens to you and I'm just really really sorry. And uh people are I would say 99% of people are um accepting of mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes but the thing is how you respond to it. And so what I described by by me doing it and by uh kind of me and my co-founder being very focused on it, it drives that culture in the team. And that gave us the idea of what if we could drive that culture into flow and flow's interactions. So if for example flow misses something, how does it communicate to the user like hey like super sorry this happened for you. Uh we've saved this thing here so you can go retry this if you want. We haven't lost it. Uh but like totally understand this is like frustrating and we've like told our team we'll like fix it next time. So having very empathetic messaging is is important that that goes into a lot of the way we specifically design those those features as well cuz just like an intern like when the person makes mistakes you want them to just accept the mistake. You want them to uh be able to kind of just like not not leave you hanging and give you kind of like recourse like I'll go fix this thing or just like yeah like wrote 90% of this thing but maybe you want to fix a little bit of it. And this is in contrast to um and the reason I specifically mentioned how important this is because of how rare this is. Like city's been around for the last what like 15 years now. Mhm. I'm sorry I didn't get that. You hear this so often when you try to ask it something or like I'm sorry I don't know how to do this thing and you're like I just lost the thing that you at least give me something. Yeah. Are you really sorry? Yeah. Uh or you just saying that you know it loses its um it loses it the tractability of the answer. You don't you don't believe it. Yeah. Imagine like you you tell your internal like get a coffee. I'm like ah can't get a coffee. It's like you or they don't even tell you. There's like this. I don't know how to do that. Yeah, exactly. What do you mean? Like, okay, well, Google it. Yeah, just just do something. Figure out a way. And so, when we're thinking about flow and uh the the ways in which you would interact and getting to a point where we're making it take actions is a really big part. How do you handle the failures when you can't do something? Because that is just a necessary thing that is that is going to happen, right? People are going to expect a lot of you and you may not be able to match that. um how do you make people still feel good about it whether without just like leaving them hanging? You mentioned uh personification of of AIS. Uh in a previous episode I I I talked about, you know, when you look at how people design walkways and you've been on college campuses, you see there's walkways that are nice and paved and you see there's walkways that have evolved or people walk through the grass and you see a very trotten pathway. I feel like whether intentionally or not, we are personifying uh AIS and I think as we move more and more towards agentic uh implementations of modern AI, it eventually there's going to be it's going to be difficult to distinguish whether you are talking to a real human or whether an agent is completely handling something. How does that change how you build software? Because you are building software and eventually that it's going to manifest as something that feels like an agent. Mhm. So, is it like raising a child? It is in a in a lot of ways like raising a child. I don't have kids. So, like what do what do I know about raising children? Uh but the way I think about it is or is it I guess it's is it more like training a human? Like like at what point does do you stop building software and do you realize you're actually making an entity? I think you are always making an entity like writing software is a means to an end. That's not an end. The end is building this entity that people trust and people respect. Respect is a very important part of part of trust and we can we can dive into that as well because I think that's also one thing that very few people talk about when they're building these systems uh is building self-respect into these systems themselves and that is I think what you're doing at the end of the day and I there's this one talk by Rahul Vora the CEO of Superhum where he talks about applying game design principles to software design and how at the end of the day everything is about human emotions. Every feature, every bug, every word that your messaging has to users evokes emotions. And if you choose what emotions you want to evoke, that makes everything really powerful. And I feel the same way about software and all now is it's like it's very emotion driven. So inherently it's it's about the personification of it. and how do you build this this entity and design the personality? Uh, and the rest of the software just goes and builds the the the blocks to actually get there. It's underrated how much people emotionally react to the product they're using. And it's a big difference between things like consumer apps and enterprise software where enterprise software is more focused on getting the job done versus consumer apps. They tend to they tend to focus a bit more on the ergonomics of the tool because that's a that's a retention mechanism. You guys are playing in a space where it's you appeal to the average consumer because what your tool is doing is what everyone does. No one today uses a computer unless they're using a specific setup without using a keyboard, without entering text, but anyone anyone can use it. So why why is it that um that it matters so much how the user feels when they're using your tool even if they're they're focused on the outcome which is I want it to sound like me. I think humans are just emotional creatures. Um cuz they get angry. They get angry. They get happy. They they feel so many different emotions. And uh there's there's an argument that okay human beings are very irrational creatures. I don't I think humans are inherently irrational. Humans are very emotionally and subjectively driven. And we we tell ourselves stories to then uh convince us that the the reason we did things was for very strong logical reasons. And I don't think I I think that's that's a great like facade that that people have. But inherently once you like accept the fact that that humans make decisions emotionally that's when you start to really unlock the magic and like once you start to think about that in your sales in your software design in your marketing videos like what emotions are you trying to really hit with this? What level of relatability are you going for? That's when you see the most iconic products, the most iconic brands, the most iconic ads you remember. They all are just emotional experiences you have when you're talking to people to join your team. Mhm. How do you discern if they have an understanding of the importance of delighting users and evoking that positive emotion? How what do you talk to? What do you talk about with them? So, there's there's two things we do actually. The first thing that helps me sus it out in the first five minutes of conversation is I tell them to tell me about one of the favorite products that they have. And the way they describe it tells me a lot about what they care about and things that they that they notice. Uh for somebody who cares about the nuances of product design, like they have these things off the top of my head. They will tell you the smallest details. Like one person was geeking out to me about how hard it was to for for Apple to optimize the strength of the magnets in the AirPods case. So it's easy to open with one thumb. It is extremely satisfying to fiddle with this thing around all the time and it just gives you so much delight. Like every time I close this thing I hear the snap sound and like I feel so happy. and somebody spent a year probably building this thing and just hearing one of these engineers geek out about that I'm like you care about these kinds of things because you know what it takes to build this level and you can identify it. So that's a that's a huge one and then what we do after that is we throughout the challenges that we have there is always a lot of open room for them to really uh have themselves shine in how people feel. So, the best best engineers that we've hired, what they do with our take-home challenge is they go build the thing, then they show it to their friends, they get their friends reactions, then they improve it, and then they tell me why they made certain changes because that's how they saw people reacting to their software. And you just want to see that with people you bring on board. Yeah, it's it's hard to find because it's it takes a lot of empathy, like you mentioned earlier, to to figure out how are people going to feel when they touch this? what what is that what is that experience going to be like? Uh I mean for me one of the most exciting things when I started using whisper flow was I just felt it immediately allowed me to focus on what I needed to get done and eliminate the noise and and stay in work in flow. I could get an idea out and then I could put it into into a Google doc or I could drop it into you know chat GBT or something and then and then play around with with it some more. But it was so satisfying to stay in the moment of making what I was making. Tell me a bit about your perspective on flow and it's import and how important it is in the creative process and in the building process because I think being creative and building diverge at some points. Mhm. This part of so this is a very uh like when we when we put it there is like okay this makes sense right? It's very obvious but nobody has ever tried to solve this problem before which shows you how nonobvious this is when we initially built flow right what we did was we actually sat beside people and I was like do your thing I just want to stare at you work and across our team we did this for like like a hundred people right and you're like like looking at these people work and like initially they're a little conscious and they they get into the zone and they forget you're there I saw like they're they're typing an email and they're just like trying to find the right word and by the time they're done I was like what was I going to say or they're like trying to find where to perfectly place the right comma or they're like in the flow working really fast but you see them misspell a word then they go back and try to correct the word and then they're typing half as slow cuz they lost their train of thought and these are three examples but there's so many more that we saw and that got us to like okay these are all the challenges that are coming up how can we go and solve it which is where the idea for flow came up in the first place when we saw people do these things on their computers and then um that's where we were like okay let's try this hypothesis what if we don't show anything to people they don't have to think about what the final thing is going to be like they can just focus on just putting everything in their mind out and then we'll do a good job of presenting them something that they can comprehend that they feel proud about that they feel understood with like, oh, I was saying a list of five things. You actually made it into bullets. I didn't tell you to. That's amazing. Uh those those small things uh really ended up mattering to people. And that is still uh very much like how we build any new feature at at Whisper is like, okay, show me your flow. Like the most recent thing we've been seeing is there are hundreds of millions of people in the world where what they do is they're they're writing an email for example then they go paste it into chat GPT then they talk to it for 10 minutes and they copy paste it back and that is honestly the most primitive way to use a large language model and that to me is is ridiculous. So if and and this is again me me staring a lot at people doing their thing uh but do that until I got flow. I did so many so many people still do that. And so the the thing that um stuff of mine is like okay how do we build and improve this experience right and and this actually then starts the process for us where we build and iterate and it's probably going to take 50 individual iterations for us to get to an experience where I'm like this is right and this hits all those spots. this is just as intuitive. I can give this to my grandfather and he'll be able to use this really well. That's when we would launch launch that feature and that's kind of how we we go and build everything. I I have to say uh one of my biggest frustrations is when I move from my Mac working getting something done to my mobile phone and I don't have flow because I then have to change again how I work with whatever interface I'm playing or if I I start an email on my on my on my Mac and then I go uh and make lunch and then I sit down as I'm meeting lunch I want to work on this is like wow it's I feel like I now have to mode switch back into the old you less less nice way of doing things when I don't have flow. And that's what kind of indicated to me this is something that's really reshaping how I work. Yeah. When when you think about changing someone's workflow, what do you what do you want someone to get out of their use of whisper flow? Like if you could describe like this is how I want to change someone's life. Mhm. this is how I want to change someone's workflow. What how would you describe that in an in in the most ideal sense? It's it's just really simple. They have more time to do the things that they want to do and that is just like what I think is is right. Like if somebody for example is doing customer support and they're like do you want to spend 8 hours of your day replying to people in their inbox? Like if you do great like you don't have to use slow I don't I don't care. But if you don't, you would rather do like more important things, spend time with your family, upskill yourself and all and this thing saves you time, like this is the tool for you. And I would really want you to go build that behavior. And so that is that is all I want at the end of the day. Um is is for people to have time to do the things they want. And as as Whisper Flow builds and as you start working or as you start uh thinking about what you're going to build in the next 3 6 12 months, Yeah. How much more are you going to start doing for users? Because with the right information from the user, you can you can not only know what they want, but you can project their intent across apps. How do you see yourself getting deeper into users uh daily workflows? So the way we think about it is um it's all again in terms of building habits and maximizing the the value that that flow adds. So, we started off with building the one thing that people use 100 times a day. Mhm. Then we're going to build the 10 things that people use 10 times a day. And then you then we're going to build a 100 things that people use once a day. Um, and that is how we kind of think about all of the products that we build. What is the next most frequent workflow that people have that is insanely painful that they would rather not do and it makes a lot of sense for us to do with flow? Because the thing that we really have with flow, right, is on the surface it looks like a very sleek voice dictation platform which is it works works fantastically. But what we actually built as the foundation for that is an overlay that lives on the system level and has access to what you're doing across every single application is able to use that context to help you do things a lot better. So now that we have this foundation, we can do a lot more for users across their different workflows. That's the thing I'm I'm most excited about. Me too. Yeah. Um, what in the most simple terms because we talked about dictation tools, we talked about workflow tools, having people do better work. What is Whisper AI building and why does it matter to anyone who has to anyone in the world? Why does it matter? We're building the new interface for the new internet. The way we're using our computers, the way we're using technology in general is going through a fundamental change. The mice, the keyboard, screens, the operating systems that have existed till now made a lot of sense for the ways in which we were using it. But in the last 2 years since everything is changing with AI, the biggest thing is computers can understand natural language. They have the ability to reason. the current ways in which we work don't make sense at all anymore. So when we recraft out what that user journey is going to look like in their daily lives, it needs a new way to think and we don't want to wait around until somebody builds something. Uh, I just want to make sure we're able to build that experience in the most delightful way for people that's very user aligned. And that's the entire reason why this company exists. The entire reason why I'm spending a better part of my 20s working on this than doing anything else that I could possibly be doing and the reason why I wake up every morning. Why? What's different now versus two years ago versus 5 years ago because you mentioned the proliferation of of new technologies and we don't need to name all of them because a lot of them have come out and a lot of them are wellnown but what is it about the change from half a decade ago to just two years ago that has made you so confident that this is the time and this is the place for you to spend uh your time or this is the moment and this and There are two reasons. I'll talk about the the less important one first and the most important one after. The less important one is the fact that there are language models, AI tools, all of these that exist now that can understand language that can reason and that can start to do things on your behalf. The more important thing is the mass market is using it. It is very rare in history and you can point I can you can count on like the the fingers of your two hands how many times it happens that the entire world starts adopting a new piece of technology. This has started happening now which to me is like this has crossed the chasm. This is at a point where this is not a Silicon Valley problem. This is not like the top 1% person of the world problem. This is a human problem and a shift in how human society works where this is now one of the most pressing things in my mind to solve. If we are building for a world that uh we want to see be aligned with technology cuz the the failure mode of there not being a good interface for people and artificial intelligence to work together is that AI starts to replace people because they don't know how to work well with it. That's not what you want. You want all of the improvements that are happening here to make you smarter, to make you better. And the only way that happens is if you can interface with it a lot more. I completely agree with that and I think that's part of the the the challenge in talking about this in common vernacular is, you know, you and I are are talking about how the fact that we're standing on the shoulders of giants. This technology to people that understand it has unlocked our ability to look even further and set the sights higher. Yeah. But it presents itself as a personified kind of pseudo replacement for humans. Yeah. But when you look at technologies when they get adopted, when people understand what they are and what they can do, they turn into an amplifier and when we start looking how companies are going to be built in the future, I think we're going to have a couple of moments where we're going to realize why this makes sense. I'll give you an example. Yeah. When we put uh a human on the moon, NASA had a lot of computers, but they weren't physical computers. They were people. They were people. They were skilled mathematicians that had the title of computer. Why? Because their job was to do repetitive, highly difficult mathematical equations to do to do projections. But that job went away. Mhm. I think a lot of jobs are going to go away because that's not the ultimate place where the human needs to be. that highly repetitive work is best put somewhere put on something that can do it and then that can free up the people to think to think better and and to think at the on about higher level problems. Where do you think we're going to see that in technology? The biggest drive that I'm seeing right now, and this is one that I just very strongly believe in and um I'm I'm a huge supporter for is the tools that are coming up that let you build software with natural language. Mhm. I started building software when I was when I was 10 years old. And to me, it was one of the most powerful things cuz you can dream of something. You can decide to do a task and then you can spend 10 minutes writing code to do something that would otherwise have taken me as a person months to do otherwise. And that has now for example become democratized. A lot of people are saying engineers are going to lose their jobs because they were the ones who essentially had the power to go and build this machine. they could speak to the machine and now everyone can everybody in the company whatever small thing they need to build they can just actually go build it today and there's fantastic tools like replet or vzel or what like curs and all of these other tools are doing and um it's it's absolutely fantastic and yeah a lot of engineers are going to lose their jobs like me personally like I've I've probably written more code than I've spoken English or any verbal language in my life like that that's how close it is to me and now 80% of my engineering is is natural language based like so that that to me was the big point I was like okay I thought I was like a pretty good programmer but if this can make me even better than what I thought was uh like peak performance then that's something really special and imagine what it can do to people who were otherwise at just just ground zero and could not code and they have the ability to now go build things so that's going to happen. Question is like is it is it bad that a lot of engineers are going to lose their jobs and they need to find something else like yeah I feel bad for all the college grads coming out right now with computer science degrees into this world that is very different than the world that they entered college in 4 years ago where it was a good idea to still study computer science. Um but on the bright side instead of a few hundred million people there's 8 billion people now who can build software and that is I think what technology usually does and there's these hiccups that come along the way but I feel it's just a necessary part of evolution. I have a lot of opinions on this and I love and I love the way you framed it. First of all, I I love Replet. Yeah. And I and I use it and I only use the agents in natural language and I can code. I've got a computer science degree and I and I love writing code, but I'm trying to challenge myself to think differently. I wrote my first program on a graphing calculator. I did it because I hated doing vector math. And I made an agreement with my with my physics professor if I showed him that I wrote the program to do all of this vector math, could I use uh could I use the the calculator on tests? And he said, \"Absolutely.\" Well, that was great for me, but then all of a sudden my classmates were wondering, \"How is he getting this done so quick?\" And they started asking me for the program. It's like, well, as soon as I started sharing it with them, I started realizing they didn't know what they were doing. Yeah. They were just punching the numbers in and they were moving on. Now, is that bad now? I'm not quite sure. Is it important when you're studying physics to understand how to do a physics equation or to understand physics? Yeah. You know, I've been talking to a lot of new grads. um people I mentor graduating from college now like looking to enter the workforce in the next few months and the the reason I mentioned this earlier top of mind is there's a lot of fear there's a lot of fear that what did I just spend the last four years of my life studying why does it matter if I know the syntax of this thing or not like are my skills just useless and the thing that I that I tell them the thing that I have always thought and continue to think is the most important skill that you need as an engineer. And like what truly being an engineer means is you have the ability to take a big complex problem and then div it up into smaller tasks. Know how to stage those tasks and then if you can do those tasks or not, it doesn't matter. If you use whatever tool you want to go like build these things out, none of that matters. But figuring out what that complex task is, how do you break it down? That is the most important skill. And that is I think one of the things that because of these tools right now, this is like the negative consequence that you see. People are stopping to do that. And I saw this happen with a with a couple of um uh people that that I was kind of seeing work as well. Instead of trying to do that, they just try to give the whole problem to one of these AI systems. And again, you're not giving enough context. You're not giving enough details to exactly what you want and then it just produces and you're like why? And then you keep trying to debug it with it instead of just being like let me do this part of it myself. Let me not be lazy about this part. And then what these tools are really good at is doing these small things that I tell them uh that each are like small things you you go fix. Anybody can do that. But this is the most the the big part is the most important thing as a skill that you need to build as an engineer. Uh I think if you do that you never need to worry about not having a job cuz that that skill is one of the most precious skills that that people need. One of the things that you know when you go back to talking about dictation tools uh a lot of users have experience with them and and they and they play in all these different environments. Some users swear by them while other users refuse to give up their keyboards. Yeah. How do you view the divide and how are you working to bring users that don't want to give up their keyboards or had a bad experience with dictation tools? How how do you what's your message to them and how are you leading the company to kind of serve those users that may have been underserved, may have had a bad experience and are unwilling to trust tools like yours? I would say people who love voice dictation and people who like religiously love their keyboards are an extremely small fraction of the human population. Let's say like sub 5%. 95% of the world lives in this place where it's like I don't know any better. This is the thing that I've been using and my dad used and my grandfather used and we've all been using for the last like three generations in my family. And I tried this voice thing once and it kind of sucked and and Siri sucked and it's kind of annoying. So I don't want to do it. Everything I think about is is focused on this 95% of the population. These are people who don't know any better. But there is there is better. What I found for us is actually it's very interesting for for some companies there is a a lot of demand. People have a problem. They're looking for a solution. For some companies, people don't know that is a problem. And so you first need to educate them about that and then show them the solution. What we found works best is when there is somebody who already uses whisper, they go and they say to the world like, \"Hey, this is a thing. I love using it. This is actually better than the other systems you might have tried out.\" And it helps me get my job done so much better. That sparks people's creativity and it opens their mind up to trying something new. And we literally saw this happen in the studio when you were you were telling one of the sound engineers like, \"Hey, uh, this like like Whisper is fantastic.\" He was like, \"Oh, how does it differ from Dragon?\" And it's like, \"Oh, it's like incomparable. It like gets all these mistakes right, insanely fast, all of that.\" and and he's probably now curious and he'll probably go check it out later today because he's like, \"Okay, you dispel the myth that this is going to be similar to an experience that I've had before and it's going to be better.\" And so what we do as a company in our marketing is just take all the users that are like you and put them up on the on the stage to share their message with the world because it matters a lot more what they have to say than what I can sell about my own company because of course I'm biased. Yeah. Well, when when you started getting deep into the into the challenge of building whisper flow, what was a problem that you thought would be easy that ended up being really hard? Uh, it is painfully hard to uh deliver on that zeroedit message and really like understand what people what people mean, right? Um and the the reason is human rambles like if you for for some users who actually decide to share their data with us to improve the models we like we we read through them and it's like what this person said is like completely incomprehensible jibber it's like I don't even know what this thing means or what this is supposed to do. So, we did this um uh this this thing at the office recently where we just took some of these these messages that people had and all of us on the team had to write down what a what a formatted version of this message would be that the user likely wanted and it was all different. Uh and and that's just like now I say that like your your eyes go up cuz it's like all different. It was like yeah this is just like super strange. And then you're like trying to solve this problem and giving something that something to like what what people want. It requires so much contextual understanding. And like I do I do this a lot as well. Like I'm like hey can you look at this um this thing uh you know the the thing that I was was talking about earlier like what's that word? I don't know. Anyway, let's like move on. This is how I talk. And like in conversation it seems normal but imagine having this like written down and you're just like I have no idea what this like 70word sentence is going on about. Oh yeah. I think the most exciting thing about tools uh like logger language models is they've shown us they can kind of understand what you mean but that understanding also I don't I don't know what your opinion on this is but you know when you think about what a large language model is it really is just guessing you know kind of like a kind of like a um lossy lossy compression you know and at the same time they're getting really good at figuring out what you're trying to say. So, what happens when or what do you think will happen when models start to get good at predicting what you're going to say and they start being able to work and and infer what you want faster than you can say it? I feel there needs to be a lot more work in that. And like going back to this example that I just gave you, right? Yeah. This is the reason why for all the other models out there, their zero edit rates are 5%. Mhm. And that is the challenge that we had to solve. And imagine going from that gibberish to getting to a 90% of your messages are are perfect when they get out is the hard thing we had to solve while getting there. And getting there gets us to the next point where you can start to be more proactive to people, right? Uh you have 200 emails. you probably, you know, based on what you've said before, flow might know what you might just say to more than half of them and it can prefill that for you so you don't have to repeat yourself again and again. And that again comes to me about what are things that you could do for people that let them do what they want a lot more than spend time in doing wrote work that they don't feel that inspired about. And so I think that's where a lot of the proactivity is going to help. The thing to keep in mind is you don't start to impede into things that people actually find delightful. Um, and I think that ends up being more of a user self- selecting thing. So I I at least right now think that's less of a worry that we need to have and more so just let's put this out there. Let's start to do things for people. Uh, respect their preferences if they want like things done a little differently, things not being done at all. there's going to be a little back and forth because not everybody at this moment is going to be comfortable with, you know, uh somebody else doing all their all their work for them. But I think that's also going to be a change in human behavior that we see where you're just going to be a little more comfortable with that, a little more comfortable with things being proactive. And to some degree, like people have been trying to build this for the longest time. This was what Microsoft's Clippy was like 20 years ago and they they were trying to do that. Now, of course, like this thing wasn't the most intelligent thing. Uh could say it was like kind of good for the time when it came out, but I think like in the next year or so, something like that is very viable and I think it could be a a huge unlock to people. Well, you said some you said a phrase that I really liked, which is people do all their work. Yeah. What what is work? Like what are these what work are these are people doing? Because if if you're finding that people bring whisper flow into their workflows and they happen much faster. Mhm. What is the work people are really doing and how do we help people see that they can define themselves by more of what they can get done versus what they're doing? That's actually a really good point. Uh it reminds me of this I forget the name of the guy. He wrote this new book called Slow Productivity. Uh was the do you know the name of the author? I do not know the name of the author. He he's written a couple of other uh fantastic fantastic books as well including deep work and it was all about there there's so much focus today in society about people measuring themselves by like I did 8 hours of work. I responded to 500 emails and like you measure it with that and that is inherently true for information workers, people who are especially working in managerial roles, people who are working in like consulting and so on because it is very hard to see the fruits of your labor. Like in a lot of other roles it's actually easier like if you're a farmer like you don't care if you're spending 10 12 hours a day or not. you care if your crops grow at the end of the year and you can go sell them for a good price and they don't rot away. But with these roles, it's hard to see impact because so many layers of bureaucracy come in. The actual tangible value is is very far away. You can't really attribute it back to the person. So people need some way to figure out, am I doing enough? Am I doing a good job? I don't know if I just work 2 hours a day, but I still get a lot done. Is that is that a good thing? Am I not work? Am I am I lazy? And I don't personally have a a strong view on that. And I'm I'm also at times in that in that boat as well. You know, after after long days of work, like work 18 hours and I'm just like sitting on my dining table and being like, did I do enough today? Do I need to do more or can I just go go sleep now? And sometimes there's not a not a good answer to that question. Yeah. I think when we talk about the abundance that AI is going to bring, I think it will be around that that nexus of how do we make sure that people are productive. Yeah. Not just doing work. And when we look at businesses, I have this metric that I like to judge business by. And this is this is easier done with with publicly traded companies, but just take the amount of revenue a company brings in and divide it by the number of employees. Yeah. That'll tell you where the rocket ships are. Did you by the way see the new replet integration we built into flow? I did not. So when when did you guys release it? Two days ago. Okay. So on Wednesday we did we did a big big launch. Yeah. For the window for the window for Windows and part of it was also announcing our partnership with Replet where what you could do is so you're having a conversation with somebody. I was like oh you know what if we can build an app that did this this this it would be fantastic. You just highlight it and then you say, \"Flow built an app for this.\" That's it. You don't have to leave your place, whatever. It can just go do that. I did it recently where I was like typing out tweets and actually, \"Hey, Flo, can you make a make a thing that makes my tweets more viral?\" And then it was going and building an app in the background while I was doing my thing. And then it was ready by the time I was done. That's incredible. So this I find is like one of the most powerful tools that we built in and it pushes forward more of where I think software is going more in the space of instead of having apps that you select and download beforehand is going to be a lot of contextual applications that are built on the spot for the thing you need to do then they get spun off doesn't matter to do all the little one-off things that come up in your life all day long. I'm just curious what is the most memorable piece of feedback that you got from a user that's using whisper flow and how did it change what you're what you're guiding the team to build. So this is a really interesting thing that came out some time back and this was by Rajie who was the the CEO of Product Hunt. Mhm. And he started using flow organically then then reached out to me cuz he loved the tool. And the thing he said that really stuck with me was flow has actually changed how I think and how I articulate by making me go directly from my thoughts to something that is there in front of me. I structure my thoughts differently and I am more thoughtful when I am saying things. And that was interesting because that starts to hint towards this being a tool that helps people think better, that helps people think more clearly. And this is an emergent behavior as people use the tool more on essentially them learning how to use the tool better. the same way you learn how to use the keyboard better as you use it. And so you're starting to see that. And then the thing is uh we do the opposite of what the keyboard did, right? The keyboard tried to make people slower by by pushing things around so it doesn't get jammed. We don't have those limitations. What can we do to make people think even better? What are tools for expressing yourself that we can build into flow? And the result of this is going to be things that we build in that people are not going to be identifying like this thing helps me think better. What they're going to identify it is I just do work much better when I use flow. This thing is delightful. It's so seamless. I don't have to edit anything. Like my team likes my messaging a lot more. And those are the results that people are going to see. But that really happens if you are able to communicate a lot better. And that is something that I think very few software products in the world or anything in the world really has the ability to do is shape someone's thought process which I think is magical. That is magical. It it had a similar impact on me and that's why I reached out to you was I found that this was an unlock. Yeah. And I've been in software for 30 years. Yeah. When you see something special, you really know. Mhm. Uh and like I said, this it makes it makes my top 10 uh fascinating when you think about you we talked about easy problems ended up being hard when you're building. What's a hard problem that ended up being really easy for you all? We thought it's going to be very challenging to get people to install a software on their computer that's pretty much like running in the background. um and that can go and write into every application that especially the world is very privacy sensitive. People care a lot about their data. The thing we learned is it's actually very easy to solve. Uh the way you do it is is don't uh do shady stuff and just be very transparent with people. And so with flow, the way we solved it is essentially just had very clear messaging like hey we need your mic for this thing we need this thing so that we can paste into any application and if you don't want us to do like particular parts of you can turn these things off in the settings if you care about that privacy but here's why we we need these things and like we really care about privacy and so during the first few seconds of interaction with the product people start to feel that trust and you actually have about only 1 to 2% of the users drop off at that stage where they're giving us uh kind of system level permission to do things on their behalf on their computer. Um so that I think is maybe one of the lowest drop off points that we were we were expecting uh at all in the the product overall compared to what I had seen in a lot of other companies before on what just you know funnels look like. So we spent a lot of time here talking about input an interface for input. How do you see output changing? You know a lot of people with whisper uh would ask us why don't we build text to speech inside whisper so that it can talk back to you and the and this is this comes up very often and a lot of people think that is the future of systems talking back to you and that is what it should really feel like. I think that's a very wrong assumption to make because it's not grounded in real hard facts, which is when you're consuming information, your eyes can do it so much faster than your ears even can. And when you're looking at consuming visual content, when you are talking about discovery, when you're talking about consuming a large volume of say like textual or structured information, your eyes are the best way to do that. So, we're not going to see displays die. That's why whenever I talk about it, I talk about going from uh display first to voice first interfaces. not completely killing the screens because they're very useful for certain set of tasks. And so here's the and if we if we're like drawing out this this world here like what you need is uh a voice interface cuz language is a common input modality. What you need is a display interface uh to be able to receive information in a very um high bandwidth fashion. And what you need is the ability to then also put in more non-verbal cues. And that could come from like facial micro expression, could also be gestures you make with your eyes and being able to capture that to do more uh spatial work overall. And those to me from first principles are like the three building blocks that you need. One incarnation of that is wearable glasses. 50% of the human population wears glasses, so it's not too far off from what people are used to. You have a display on them. You have the ability for them to capture audio really well, give audio back to you, and then some more sensing technology that lets you capture gestures, expressions, all of that. That to me is a full complete system. And I would say has I I would actually go as far to say I'm like extremely confident that that is what we're going to be using 5 years from now and you're going to see that have a huge explosion in the Silicon Valley first. Yeah. Uh as as we proceed and a few years after that in in the rest of the world it would start to get more common. In the same way we used to carry laptops with us everywhere. Then when phones came, you started leaving your laptop at home and carrying your phones around. Now when these would come, you would carry your phones around a lot lesser cuz you're going to be able to do almost everything you can do with these devices. This is going to be your your portable thing you carry everywhere. And you might just leave your phones at home and they may look different, be much bigger cuz you would primarily use it for more content consumption-y things. Like why else would you need a big screen? And that is just going to be a really really exciting leap forward. One piece of advice you would give yourself. Mhm. Before you started Whisper AI to not take things too seriously. I think life is life is stressful. Uh there's things that don't go your way every time. Mhm. Like every every day, multiple times a day. And as somebody who keeps striving for the best, that was something that I just didn't accept. And there was a there was a part of my younger self who was like, \"No, I can I can make everything perfect and really strive towards that.\" But what ends up happening is you you try to spend a lot of your mental energy on that last like 5% that you don't have control over and that just shoots you in the foot. So that's been something that I've started to personally adopt a lot over the last year or so. Just makes me so much happier. There are things that are in your control. There are things that are not. And you just like shrug your shoulders and go to the next thing. And as you came to that sort of perspective, like how much of that was influenced by previous startups or previous companies you had worked at versus how much do you just figure out by being introspective and looking at the at the past objectively? So this specific one was just purely purely on whisper cuz um I think this was one where everything always moved for us as a really fast pace. And so in a single day I would be going from like extremely ecstatic to just like a terrible thing happens and then back and forth and back and forth every single hour. And there was just no way to sustain that level of emotional variation without needing to just have a different outlook on life. And I feel like that at least to like an emotional or mental degree, I wasn't challenged before this company. You seem like someone that loves challenges and that and once you find something you love, it's impossible to get you off of it. What advice would you give to aspiring founders or many of these new grads that might they might decide, hey, I I listened to TA and he told me that maybe now is the time. What what advice would you give them about just starting their own thing or embracing the uncertainty of building uh from nothing? I think there's a lot of people who think that that the job as a as a founder of your own company is is glorious. And I think like that's just what it looks like on the surface. what being a founder is about is like there's a lot of it where you are alone figuring things out by yourself. It's painful. You get the highest highs, the lowest lows and it really challenges you the most to an emotional and mental level. So that is something that you know the the way I always think about it is like everybody decides their own paths. I wouldn't say being a founder is the best idea for anybody like if this is right for you then you go do that. But the thing I do want to want to share with people like what it looks like to be on this side so that they can go make their own decisions uh for themselves. That is a conversation. I'd love to understand from your perspective like how would you describe the mission of Whisper AI to someone that's never heard of the company but but may be interested in knowing what you guys do. We are building the most effective way for people to communicate with other people and with technology. And if we succeed at that, I think that's a life well spent. When you succeed, when we succeed at that,"

        "srt": "Being able to express our thoughts directly in natural language is definitely much faster than typing. This is also a prerequisite for vital coding. The tool I'm introducing today is quite remarkable. It might be the most powerful speech input software currently available. Let me show you the results first. This software is based on OpenAI's whisper which is currently the best speech text tool available. Today I will introduce you two methods. The first one is an open-source code repository on GitHub. Awesome. This is super cool. Okay. And How about this? However, for most people, deploying this tool, deploying this code directly from Mac OS can be quite challenging. So, I've done two things. First, I translated it into English. Second, I summarized the simplest local deploy method. I believe that the vast majority of people should be able to master it following my tutorial. You see the results is so accurate. Of course, if you still find my steps too cumbersome, you can jump to the end of the video for the second method, installing a whisper keyboard application. That's a mature paid software with a $10 monthly subscription fee, but it might be more convenient to use. All right, without further ado, let's start explaining the complete free local deployment method for whisper input. Let's make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your Mac. Open terminal and type. You should see version 3.10 or higher. If not, please install Python first. Download the project. Let's start by downloading the source code. In your terminal, navigate to where you want to install the project and run these two commands. Step two, get your API key. You'll need an API key from Croc. Visit console.croc.com. Create account if you don't have one and copy your API key. We'll use this in the next step. Step three, initial setup. Now let's run the setup script. First run this code. Then run this. The script will create av file for you. When prompt edit this file and add your configuration. Basically, you need to set service platform to Krogue and set uh CRUG API key to the actual API key we got from step two. Step four, system permissions. This is the most important step. This app needs two permissions to work properly. Go to system preferences. Select privacy and security. Select accessibility. Then find terminal in the list and check the box. Also under privacy and security select microphone and find terminal and check the box. Launch the application. Now you are ready to start. Run this code. You should see initialization message and voice assistant started. That means it's working. Using whisper input is simple. Hold the option key and speak. Release to transcribe your speech. The text will appear at your cursor position in any application. The final step is optional. If you want to launch the app more easily, you can create a desktop shortcut using Automator. First open Automator from your application folder. Then select application as a document type. Next search for run shell script in the actions library and drag it to your workflow area. In the script box, enter a script in the video description session. Make sure to replace the path with your actual project path. Save this as an application to your desktop or application folder. Now you can doubleclick this app to start whisper input without opening the terminal. That's it. You now have the most powerful speech to text tool running on your Mac. The setup only takes a few minutes, but the time you save using voice input will be enormous. Alternatively, if you prefer native Mac OS application, Whisper Keyboard is an excellent option. However, the free version only allows 20 sentences per day, which is definitely not enough for regular use. For unlimited sentences, you need to pay uh $10 per month. Uh that said, I believe whisper input is already good enough for most users. For more help, check the GitHub repository issues. Happy voice typing. I see you in the next one. Bye-bye. [Music] I'm on my way. [Applause]"

And this is gamechanging. Do you remember Dragon Naturally Speaking? This dictation app that came out, oh, I don't know, 10, 15 years ago, and it was supposed to give you hands-free control of your computer. Well, you know, I'm pretty techsavvy, and I could never get that to work. It drove me insane. I finally gave up on it. I think I paid the subscription twice to try it again. So, I spent over $1,000. By memory, it was like $600 for the year. And anyway, um, and I did that twice because I'm a glutton for punishment. This app, however, actually works. It's called Whisper Flow. And Whisper is whi PR. I will put the link in the actual LinkedIn post because you've got to try this. Two weeks free. Um, and you get more free if you use the link to refer. So, if you sign up for it, I'll get more free time. But that's not why I'm sharing it with you. Okay. So, let me show you how it works. Uh, it truly just takes dictation. Once you install it, you can see either a button that you can push on there your computer with your cursor or I just find it easier to type the function or hit the function button. David to. Okay. So, it's pulled up my partner. This is a test. Hey David, I am testing this really cool new app called Whisper. Oh no, I don't want to say that actually. David, hi. How are you today? I'm testing a new app called Whisper that I think you should check out. I'll add the link below. See, it knew that I when I said no, I don't want to say that. It deleted that. So, it typed what I wanted to say instead of what I did say. as opposed to some AIS that shall remain nameless. Siri and the other cool thing is that you can actually program little snippets to use. So instead of typing or saying what you want to sign off with, I just say email signature and it says thanks Kim. Or if I want to include my email address, email address. Oh, it's actually email, not address. So, it added address for me. Isn't that cool? And you can use it on anything. You can use it on anything on your computer or your phone. It's got an iOS. I'm not sure about Android, but it's got an iOS app as well. Let me share uh something else with you. Okay, so this is a um a task that I started to write out for my uh assistant Clarissa. And instead of writing it, I'll just test it. I'm shooting a video on Whisper. This will be for our Everyday AI newsletter on Friday. Oh, no. Actually, we're putting it together on Thursday now. So, it's for our Everyday AI newsletter on Thursday. I'll type the copy, but here's the link to the video. Could you trim it because I'm sure I flubbed up somewhere. And after all that, you get I'm shooting a video on Whisper. This will be for our everyday AI newsletter on Thursday. I'll type the copy, but here's the link to the video. Could you trim it because I'm sure I flubbed up somewhere. You can also edit it, and I haven't figured that out yet because I've literally been playing with it for 5 minutes before I turned on the camera. I was so excited about sharing this with you. So, give it a go and let me know what you think. I'm really keen. But to me, it is lifechanging. I can talk a lot faster than I can type. And I'm a pretty fast typist, so this is going to save me hours and hours and hours. So anyway, give it a go and let me know how you go. Bye."

        "srt": "Hello there Mac friends. Uh this is Brent Dman and I'm going to do kind of a blind uh test of a app I heard about. Uh there's many AI apps that uh uh recognize your voice and let you do dictation. Uh this is one called Whisperflow.ai. Uh I heard about it on the podcast My First Million and I'm going to take a look because they rated it quite highly. So, I've already downloaded it to my Mac and I've started some of the installation process. So, we'll get to it and we'll switch to the app right now. So, here's the app, uh, Whisper Flow. Uh, I've already did the sign up. You've got to create a account. Uh, you got to get your permissions. Um, and so I've already um allowed permissions for P clipboard access. So, let's allow permissions for microphone access. Okay, so permissions are done. Account is created. Got a lot of do sorry you have to do a lot of things before you can get value it seems. Uh but okay now you can see here that it does hear me. So I believe um it is talking about my computer's built-in mic. I'm using an external mic. Um I don't see that as a selection but okay. We'll click yes. Um okay. So now we're being told it uses a keyboard shortcut. Um and so uh what's the keyboard shortcut we want to assign? Um I think we can try this. Although it should be taken by something else, but let's see what happens. So yes, sounds like we're ready. I'm going to hit continue and we'll go through the tutorial here. Flow works in any app from emails to chats to documents. flow works in any text box on your computer. So, that's what I was hoping that I could start to dictate something. Uh, let's [Music] uh when we press it down, it doesn't do anything. Um, it's showing lots of apps here. Use flow with a keyboard shortcut. So, hold on the function key to speak and insert the spoken text. So, can showing uh Okay, so I guess we can do a test here. So, let's hold it down. I want to send a message to my friend here. Okay. So, I let the uh option key come up and it did a command paste. So, now you can see that it did get it. Um, so it's in record mode as long as you hold down the button and then starts the dictation once you lift it up. So then you can see a little response. What are we going to do? I think we did our test. So let's finish. Okay. So welcome back, Brent. We have a whole quite a big window for what this does. And it looks like it's trying to give me some idea of how fast I'm typing, how many words I've done, and how much usage I'm doing. So, that's kind of a good idea. So, voice dictation any app. Um, it has previous things that I've typed. So, and then there's a um pro version. We're on the basic version. It looks like we have a dictionary. So, it's put in the dictionary my name and my email address. Uh, please don't spam me. Um, then we have a settings section. So, I always like to check out the settings. So, we are using the default shortcut. Uh, I could also select the microphone. So, let's try and do that. So, this is the USB microphone I'm using. Now, I'd like to um try that. And then languages. Right now, it looks like it can support many languages. Auto detect is on. So, looks like it has Cantonese support, which is good. I'm always interested in languages that are not uh or Asian languages. There's a Japanese support. Um I did I miss Chinese as well or Mandarin? Oh yeah, Mandarin simplified is there. Cool. So the the main languages I'm speaking or learning are there. I think I will leave it on auto detect for the time being. Okay. Uh let me move my head out of the way for a second. Close this. So that's the defaults. What about system? Okay. So it's going to be launched when I log in. Uh and show flow bar. So uh keep the dictation bar at the bottom. Okay. So there's a flow bar down here. So in the text box, press start next. Okay. Hide the bar. So there's a way to hide it. You can change the microphone from there and change language and stuff as well. Okay. So, we have this little flow bar here and you can click to start dictating. All right. Then, let's go back here to back to the system. Show app and dock. So, you could hide the app in the dock, but it's there. Uh, interactive sounds. Yeah, that's probably useful. Then, mute audio while dictating. That's probably what I want, but I'm going to leave the default for now. Some personalization as well. What does personalization do? It looks quite empty. Okay. Uh, I don't think I need to check account, but let's just see how much this costs. So, free is 2,000 words per week. Lightning fast voice typing. Edwards to dictionary in 100 languages. Annual one is 144 per user per year. unlimited. Um, so it has a command mode. So I think this command mode you can uh control your computer with your voice. Um, okay. So it shows me the basic settings. So basically you're doing $15 per user per month. All right. Uh, let's close this now. And I think um it's time to give it a try in another application. Believe I have a text editor open right here. Okay. So, let's create a brand new uh new window with a new untitled document and let's start our uh our dictation journey. I'm going to write a very long book uh about how use uh this Whisper Flow product. Okay. So, using my third party microphone did not work. I wonder if that is because uh I'm recording to that third party microphone. So, we got an error there. Let's hit stop, open settings, and we'll go to select microphone again. Let's try with my Sonos microphone since I'm wearing that. Okay, let's go back and we'll press the button. I'm going to write a tutorial on how to use this flow software and so maybe I can speak faster and do faster dictation than normal. Let's see what happens. So, we see the dots are going. Okay. So, it does it's not as uh instantaneous as I would expect, but uh given that it's probably going to open AI or somewhere and coming back and let's see how the text is. I'm going to write a tutorial on how to use this flow software. So, maybe I can speak faster and do fasteration than normal. Let's see what happens. Okay. Okay. So, you do have a little bit of a pause between when you speak and when you see um let's keep going. Uh so, uh I think what I'll do is I'll let me switch to my um my agent here and just turn this into um ask. and we'll do it with Claude. Okay. Uh then we will go back to Safari and give it some context. Okay. So fetch and then this [Music] URL. Okay. There we go. Did it. Um, now instead of typing, let's dictate. Write me a script for uh introducing this program uh whisperflow.ai. I want to make a YouTube tutorial as I go through and try and use this new tool. So, I've let go of the button and it's processing definitely. There we see. So, now we have me a script for introducing this program whisper flow. So, it looks like um might have had a little bit of a delay in getting started. Okay. So now let's uh just hit and see what kind of script we get back. Okay. So there we have some dictation. Uh so let's see if there's anything I forgot here. Um you know uh we've gone through the preferences. Um it seems uh we could test some languages I think is what's the next thing. Um so let's try um speak some Chinese. Okay, as you can see down here, maybe I'll just put it back up here. So, so it didn't get my name correct in Chinese. Okay, this looks like traditional characters. Um, very interesting. Uh, okay. What about uh um let's see. Yeah, this looks like traditional characters. Um, wonder if I can switch to different input simplified characters. And then let's try this again. Okay. So, this looks much better and it really captured it. Um, okay. So, I think, um, you might have to switch to the input method, of course, which makes sense. Uh, it probably doesn't automatically switch as easily. Okay, so I was trying to do Japanese. It did not detect it even though I had chosen the Japanese method. So let's try this again. Genki. Okay, that's definitely not Japanese. So Chinese, it had a better uh start. Um, okay. So, now it's recording. I thought I saw a way to Let me try and get the menu up here. Ah, yes. Here's the menu. So, you can hide it. Go to settings. You can change the microphone. Uh, show all languages. Okay. So, let's try and select Japanese here. cannot type Japanese. So, it's quite nice how it only shows the languages it thought it heard before. Okay, let's go now. All right, so go to a new line and let's try again. H, okay, much better. So, now that I've specifically chosen Japanese, I think it got it correct. Um, although I'm not that good with the only characters. I'm just beginner in Japanese. Okay, so we've got tested whisper with uh Chinese and Japanese. Uh, I mean, I'm not going to probably go too too long, but um I think this was a good test. Let's go back to our stats and see what it's telling us now. So, we've done 86 words, have a oneweek streak, and we have 111 words per minute. If we click on these stats, um, okay, it does kind of a leaderboard. So, like, oh, trying to get me to engage. Um, yeah, like, uh, tries to have some humor in the app, which is always fun. So, I'm looks like they get a lot of people that just download the app and sign up and just do one sentence because I'm already top 3%. Uh, and I've only done 111 words. So, I think this is a pretty new app. Um, I'm gonna I I mean like it's quite nice. Uh, I also have another one that's just called Whisper and it's updated quite a bit and I quite like it. So, I I might, you know, test this more. and see which one is better. Uh, and maybe some other time I will uh go and do a walkthrough of Whisper and how I use that for dictation. Okay, thanks a lot my Mac friends. Appreciate you joining and we'll see you next time."

        "srt": "Which one is the best Whisper Flow or Aqua Voice? Now, they are basically the same software. They are dictation tools that let you convert your audio or your speech into text and they position themselves as a tool to let you prompt with AI much much faster because instead of just typing manually, you can tell AI with your voice speaking and then it will produce the prompt that's accurate to your voice and it is being powered by AI and therefore it can fix any error or or any mistake that you say when you are speaking the words. So I think these tools are very very close. Whisper flow is already established and then we have a new contender called Aqua Voice and even though they are the same there are few differences. So one example here, Aqua Voice as a new player claims to be faster than Whisper Flow and they also claim to be much more accurate than Whisper Flow. Although uh the data is based on their own benchmark and I have seen many companies claiming that their product or their speech model is better than competitors. And I I can tell that this is definitely biased. This is not going to represent real life because there is no uh let's there are some models that are missing like there's no deep gram noa which I think is also one of the best speech model but it is not present here for some reason even though it has similar features to aqua voice and it actually they also claim to be the best at reducing error rate but again that's why I don't really trust the benchmark because it could be very different depending on the use case. Now enough about the differences. Let's talk about the what's the same about these tools. So number one, they both are AI powered dictation tools where they can fix the mistake on your voice. You can also see the historical data about the voice that have been converted into text. So if there is any content or any text that you don't want to say again, you can just check the historical data and just copy the text. And then there is custom dictionary. So if there is any brand name or maybe product name that is foreign to AI, you can just tell AI you can put a dictionary that basically AI will understand and will make sure that the name will be properly detected the next time. And then both software are available for Mac and Windows. They also offer some settings that will ensure high privacy priority like you can just set the data to be stored on your computer. They they're not going to send the data to the server which I think is a good point. I think a lot of people are care a lot about privacy. And then lastly, they do offer free and paid plans. So if you're not ready to pay for these companies, you can just use the free plan and that's fine. Although there will be some limitations. Now I'm going to do some testing just a quick testing based on uh how do they perform. So I'm going to do mistake test emoji test context free version and pro version and in total. By the way I'm not going to do the pro version like I'm not going to use the pro versions of this software because right now I'm still using the free version of both Whisper Flow and Aqua Voice. But for this example, for this test, I'm going to talk about something else. I'm going to be talking about the pricing as well as the features that come when you are paying or using the free version of each of these software. Now, let's do the test number one. And by the way, just to confirm uh just to show you that I'm using two software. So, this is Aqua Voice and this is Whisper Flow. So they do look the same and I do believe they are built on the same technology because I can tell that this is web based technology but they converted into desktop application which is fine by the way there's no problem with that but there are some buggy experiences although I believe they're going to fix that in the near future. All right so let's uh try whisperflow first and let's try aqua voice. So, I'm going to press a keyboard shortcut to enable Whisper Flow. And then later, I will do the same for Aqua Voice. And I'm going to say the same thing. All right. Hey, remind me to buy some groceries later in the morning. Sorry, I mean in the evening. All right. You can see that it corrects the mistake. uh it didn't say it didn't show anything about morning because it knows that uh there was a mistake and therefore it fixed the mistake and now just telling just showing the correct version of the word. So that's pretty good. Now let's uh close this and I'm going to do it again for Aqua voice. Hey, remind me to buy some groceries later in the morning. Sorry, I mean in the evening. [Music] All right, it is also the same and it is yeah it is accurate that it doesn't mention anything about the morning. So the score is one and one for both tools. Now how about list test? I want to test the ability for these tools to create a list based on my comment. So let's try whisper flow first. Okay, tomorrow I want to buy number one milk, number two pizza, number three hamburger. All right, that's pretty good. How about aqua voice? Tomorrow I want to buy number one milk, number two pizza, number three hamburger. And yeah, I would say they are exactly the same except you might have noticed that there is small punctuation added at the end of the word. So there is this punctuation, another punctuation and there is this period at the end. In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with that. But I would say it is more accurate for whisper flow because if you have a list, usually you don't have to add any comma. But honestly, I don't know the convention here, so I could be wrong. But from what I can remember, it's usually correct to just not include comma after uh sentence or word in a bullet point format. So I suppose whisper flow is better here, but it's not, you know, I'm not going to call it one zero. I think it's still one and one. It's still basically doing the job pretty well. And then the emoji test. So I want to create some emojis, but by just saying it. All right, let's try whisflow. Fire emoji, rocket emoji, smiley emoji. There we go. That's pretty good. How about aqua [Music] voice, fire emoji, rocket emoji, smiley emoji. All right, they are basically identical. So, the score is still the same. One and one. Now, how about context? So, this is the one that I think I already know the answer. So, one feature that Aqua voice have is context. So, it can understand what's going on on the screen. This is optional feature by the way, but it lets AI in Aqua voice to understand what's going on, what software you're using right now and therefore it can adjust the output accordingly. So when you're working with chargity and when you're working with let's say cursor AI the output could be slightly different. One example is when you are working with AI code editor and you can specify or you can mention the uh let's say the specific element in the code and it will format it will create a syntax format. So let me give you one example. So I have win serve here and let's say uh I want to edit let me see okay let's say I want to edit this section console error message I want to change that and I'm going to provide this command using let's say whisperflow I want to edit console dot error and this is the result it's console error which is fine There is no problem with that. But if you're using Aqua Voice, it's going to be a bit different. So, I'm going to double uh double tap the Alt key on Aqua Voice. That's how you can enable the feature. Oh, it doesn't [Music] appear. Okay. Uh let me let me double check. So usually it should appear but for some reason it's uh there was a problem I guess. Let me check [Music] that. Yeah, as I said earlier the software is still a bit buggy for some reason and it's I would say because it is still very new and therefore it's not going to be smooth experience for everyone and I have seen some buggy mess happening but hopefully they're going to fix the problem very very soon. All right, let me check some settings. There could be something that I accidentally changed or maybe not. Okay, let me try it again. Okay, it still doesn't show the the mode, but I guess I cannot show it right now. But there should be an example here. Let me check the official website. So there is this context awareness and okay I think there is one example at the very top. So here uh basically you're going to see this at the at the bottom of the screen. Okay it's not playing and it can uh I can create syntax format like that and this is not available on whisper flow. So I think this feature could be very useful when you are doing the code or when you are using it for creating prompt in AI code editor. So that's the benefit of using Aqua Voice for five coding which is quite trendy lately. So for this particular case uh it's safe to say that Aqua Voice is winning. Yes, it does have context awareness but Whisper Flow they don't have it at the moment but hopefully they're going to add one in the future. So the score is 021. All right. Now the free version. This is very interesting. Both software offer free version, but you'll see that the pricing would be different. So right now the free version on Whisperflow is going to give you 2,000 words per week, which is actually quite generous. If you're not using it like crazy, 2,000 words per week is actually enough. and you will get everything all the features like dictionary or fast voice typing privacy mode support to over 100 languages etc. And on Aqua Voice for a free user you only get 1,000 free words. I don't really know whether this is per week, per month, or maybe per year like just 1,000 per new user. I don't know. But presumably, I would say this is going to be 1,000 free words per month. I think that's reasonable, which I think is very, very small compared to Whisper Flow because Whisper Flow is 2,000. And trust me, 1,000 per month is not enough. You're going to just exhaust all that in just a few days. So, 1,000 is not going to be enough. So, I don't know why they choose to give the free plan to be this little. It's almost useless. And I guess they have different reason but if you are free user then just go with whisflow. I don't think it's going to be enough for uh for aqua voice user to just rely on the free version of the tool. So definitely whisflow is more generous and let's say not enough floor is 1 to zero. All right. And now still related to the pricing, the price for yearly subscription for whisper flow is $12 a month and it includes unlimited uh unlimited words per week. It includes everything on the free version and there there's going to be the command mode which is very useful. Actually I have made a video about command mode where you can select text and then send a message to AI in whisper flow to edit the text. So you can improve the prompt with AI. So it is basically two tools in one uh in one form. I think that's going to be useful and there's going to be some features and mobile usage still only on iOS at the moment. So Android user cannot use it. That's very unfortunate. But yeah, unlimited words $12 a month. Pretty generous. But on Aqua Voice, it's even more generous. You can get unlimited words and only $8 per month. So it is cheaper than whisper flow and I would say if you are willing to pay then just go with aqua voice because it is uh more generous it is cheaper than whisperflow. So they are more generous at the pro plan but whisper flow is more generous at the free plan. I think that's the conclusion that I could made based on the pricing. So uh the pro version on whisper vlog is more expensive and aqua voice cheaper. So the score is 0 to one. So in total one one one five. So there are five and then this also five. Yeah that's uh not really surprising. Oh actually it's not five. It's actually six not five. Sorry about that. Yeah I made a mistake. Yeah, six to five. So, Whisper Flow, even though I like using it, it is actually not as good as Aqua Voice, at least based on this testing. But of course, there are many other considerations that I probably did not mention in this video. And honestly, again, based on everything, based on what I explained on this video, I would say if you're willing to pay, just go with Aqua Voice. If you are planning to just use the free version, then use Whisper Flow. And actually that's the one that I'm using right now because 2,000 words is pretty generous. So yeah, that's my that's my testing and feel free to make your own conclusion based on everything that you have heard. So if you find this video to be useful, then feel free to subscribe to this channel and I'll see you on my next video. Have a great day."

        "srt": "ever just, you know, wish you could ditch to the keyboard, just talk your way through emails, maybe some notes or even uh lines of code. Oh, definitely. Freeing up your hands, letting ideas just flow without that clack clack. Exactly. So, today we're taking a deep dive into two well heavy hitters in the voice dictation world. Whisper flow and Super Whisper. Right. Two really interesting options. And our mission is pretty simple. M help you figure out which one might be worth your time and uh your voice. Let's get into it. Okay, first up, Whisper Flow. This one's positioned as this like seamless AI powered dictation tool that works across basically every app. Yeah, the idea is integration, drafting emails in Gmail, maybe coding in VS Code or even uh just messages in Slack. And they make a big claim about speed saying it's up to four times quicker than typing. Four times. That's quite a boost. It is. But beyond just raw speed, what do that really mean practically? Like how does it feel different? Well, it's not just about getting words sound faster. It's um it's smarter than that. Whisper flow has these intelligent features, right? Like auto edits. Exactly. Auto edits, even tone matching. It tries to make the output sound, you know, natural like how you actually speak, which is pretty crucial for anything professional. Okay, that makes sense. Not just a raw transcript. Precisely. And it handles, I think, over a 100 languages. Plus, it has a personal dictionary, so if you use weird jargon or uh quirky vocab, like we sometimes do. Oh, yeah. It learns those words, gets more accurate for you over time. Okay, that sounds powerful. Deeply integrated. Yeah, but power usually comes with a cost. What's the uh the price situation? Right. So, there's a free tier to start. Gives you a 2,000word limit per week. 2,000 words. That sounds like it could go fast. It can. Yeah. Especially for heavy users. If you need unlimited words, more advanced editing commands, stuff like that, there's a pro plan for $15 a month. 15 a month. Okay. Any downsides people mention? Yeah, some user feedback mentions occasional uh hiccups with the system integration. Not always perfectly smooth and like you said, that free tier can feel pretty tight if you dictate a lot daily. Gotcha. So, Whisper Flow is kind of like this always on cloudconnected digital ghost writer. Mhm. But yeah, what if you're not keen on your voice data going to the cloud? Maybe privacy is a big concern. Uh, okay. Yeah. And that's exactly where the second option, Super Whisper, comes in. It takes a totally different path. How so? Its main selling point really is that it works entirely offline. Everything stays on your device. Oh wow. Okay, that's a big deal for privacy conscious folks. Huge. No internet needed for the basic transcription. And it still manages apparently really accurate transcription. even gets the punctuation right. So you could use it anywhere basically. Yeah. On a walk, noisy cafe. Exactly. Anywhere you might not have stable internet or just, you know, prefer to keep things local and avoid the cloud altogether. That offline thing really hits home for me, especially for sensitive notes. I can see the appeal. And you mentioned versatility. Yeah, you can sort of whisper quick notes into it maybe when an idea strikes and then later have it format that note into say a polished email or a document draft. Can you give an example? How might that actually work? Sure. Uh, imagine you're out for a walk. Brilliant idea for a project pops into your head. Dictate it into Super Whisper right there on phone knowing it's just local. Okay. Then later back at your computer, you open the app, find that note, and tell it make this an email. It formats it ready for you to maybe tweak and send. It bridges that gap between like a fleeting thought and something usable. That's pretty neat. Okay. And the cost for this Yeah. ondevice magic. So again, there's a free version for the basics, the ondevice stuff, but they also have a pro plan. That one's $849 a month. Cheaper than Whisper Flow Pro. Yeah. What does the Pro get you here? The Pro plan mainly unlocks access to more advanced AI models, but those run in the cloud. So potentially better accuracy or features like translation, but then you are sending data out. Oh, okay. So a bit of a trade-off there if you go pro. Any downsides mentioned for Super Wister? Some users feel the mobile app isn't quite as uh slick or polished as Whisper Flows yet. And apparently for really long dictations, people wish there was a more obvious pause button. Minor things maybe, but worth noting, right? Little usability things. Okay, so bringing it all together, what does this actually mean for you, the listener, trying to pick one? Yeah, if you sort of step back, it really boils down to what your priorities are. Okay, Whisper Flow seems like the winner. If you really need that deep integration across all your apps, you want those advanced AI smarts like tone matching, maybe team features are important, right? The all singing, all dancing cloud option kind of. Yeah. But if offline privacy is your absolute top concern, if keeping your data purely on your device is non-negotiable and you value simplicity, then Super Whisper is the clear choice. Exactly. It's built for that specific need. Okay. So, two strong contenders, different philosophies. Either way, it definitely sounds like uh your keyboard might be getting a bit dusty soon. It really feels like voice dictation is hitting its stride, doesn't it? Offering genuinely useful ways to interact with tech. It really is changing how we can work, how we create, which leads to a final thought, maybe something for you to ponder. Cool on. What new possibilities really open up for you personally when you can truly free your hands and your voice from the keyboard? What could you do differently?"

        "srt": "All right, so let's just do a quick review. I'm doing an agent right now for product research and you can see we're running into some errors. So let's do a practical exercise on this, right? So if you're doing any coding related work, you can go ahead and if you're in cursor, cursor is an integrated development environment that you can do for coding and you don't need to actually know code. You just need to be able to tell it what to do. So one of the benefits of it is you can go through and you you can take the error in this scenario that I'm looking to build and you can click add to chat. It's going to add the lines where your error is. And then what we can do is we can select the model that we want to iterate with. So for this one, I'm going to choose 03 because it's usually really good at complex problems. So I'm going to use that for right now. Now this is going to change depending on when you're looking at this recording. Now what we're going to do is we already have the error message there. Now I could type this, but what I've noticed is there's a really cool program called Whisper Flow. Essentially, what it's going to do is allow me to just talk and it'll it'll take it into transcripts. So, this is something that I've started to use a lot more because I can talk a lot quicker than I can type. Okay. What I'd like you to do is review the error message that you've just received and try to debug it. Use reverse chain of thought reasoning to be able to think through the context of the problem. Please use the full code base and any relevant files that you find that are necessary to help resolve this issue. If you're unsure, use any associated tools that are at your disposal, whether that's the fetch MCP model context protocol server or any others that you've been already pre-programmed to leverage. Once you have a plan of action and have thought through this, then go ahead and proceed with implementation. Now, what's going to happen is I'll go ahead and kick this off. You can see it's transcribed what I just said from audio into text and it's going to do its thing. So, just wanted to give a quick little overview of this is the process steps that you can use to be able to start doing what is known as vibe coding, but essentially being able to use AI technologies to be able to achieve any type of task that you're working"

        "srt": "Hey guys, Chris here from Whisper Systems. Today I'm going to be showing you how to update the firmware on your smart batteries. The first step is going to be connecting the adapter to the battery connector on the drone itself. And that'll just slide right on there like so. Once you have the adapter connected to the drone itself, you're just going to place the smart battery on top of that adapter. The next step is going to be connecting a USB from your laptop to the drone using the lower of the two ports. Next, open Mission Planner. If you don't have Mission Planner, there will be a download link in the description of this video. Once Mission Planner is open, you're going to want to go to this drop-own menu right here, select auto, and then click connect. Mission Planner will then pull the parameters from the drone. This will only take a few seconds. Once you're connected, you're going to want to navigate to setup in the top left. And then you're going to want to go to optional hardware. Then you'll want to go to drone canavan. And then you will select Mavink CAN 2 at the top. Once we're connected, we're going to want to find GBMS051601 and click menu and then go to parameters. And then we're going to want to change the parameters on system enable firmware updates from zero to one. And then we'll click write parameters. and click okay. And then we'll click okay one more time. Next, we're going to want to pay attention to that 119 right there. That's going to correlate to which file we're going to use to update each battery. It'll either be 118 or 119. We also want to pay attention to the firmware version. It'll change to 1.4.0 when we're done. And then we want to click menu and update. It's going to ask us if we want to search the internet. Click no. And then since this is CAN node 119, we are going to use the 119 file from the update folder. Click that and the update will begin. The first update is always going to fail. So we'll close that. And you'll notice a another node will pop up on the screen. We're going to go to the menu of that node. and click update. And then it'll ask us if we want to use the internet. Click no. And then once again, because the batteries node is 119, we'll use the 119 file. And this time, the update will proceed. The update will take anywhere from 15 to 20 seconds. Once the update is complete, you'll notice that the SW version next to the battery will change from 1.3.0 0 to 1.4.0. And now the update is complete. After you've completed updating the first battery, repeat the process on the second battery in the pair."

        "srt": "[Music] and this is Run a Profitable Gym. I'm your host, Mike Work and then I'm here with Ryan Webb. Today we're talking AI to help gym owners get stuff done faster. They couldn't help us with this podcast, but this podcast will help you with your business. Now, Ryan runs a Grove Academy in California and he uses AI at his gym. We're going to dig into that hot topic to help you run a better gym and maximize your time. So, Ryan, welcome to the show. Thank you for being here. >> Thank you for having me. >> I am pumped about this. AI is a great big topic and anything we can do to help in gym owners is going to help. So talk to me first of all what AI platforms do you use most? How many hours do you think you save each week by using them? >> Primarily chat GPT >> and uh in conjunction with that I use Whisper Flow a lot. For me it's lots of hours because I'm horrible at writing and editing and they kind of do it for me. Okay. >> And um I can just ask it what I need it to do and it'll do it. >> Mhm. Okay, so you're using Chat GPT and Whisper Flow. Let's dig into exactly how you use these platforms. Like, let's talk about your workflow and what AI does for you. What do you do? >> I mean, I use them both for I use Whisper Flow for anytime I'm going to put text into a text box. >> Okay? >> Because I'm a creative and an entrepreneur, I could care less about spelling and grammar and punctuation and all that stuff. And uh I tend to repeat myself or have filler words like ums and that >> and other voice dictation stuff picks up on all of my bad speaking habits. But Whisper Flow clears it all out and then whether that's direct to a a a blog or as dictations to chat GPT to then um build it out further or to build SOPs with. I don't do anything anymore that I'm typing with my thumbs. I use whisper flow for everything. >> So it I haven't used this app. So what you'll do then is you and Jonathan Goodman talked about this at Summit. Is that where you first heard about it? >> Yeah, that's where I first heard about it. >> Okay. So, how does it work exactly? You just use it and you'll talk into it and instead of just transcribing every uh pause and other things, it'll transcribe what you're doing, but also improve it. Is that what happens? >> Yeah, it improves it. Um, it makes punctuation perfect if you've said the same thing multiple times in different ways. It sort of picks what it thinks is the best one and cleans it up so you don't have the same thing repeated a bunch of times. makes punctuation perfect and kind of understands what you're trying to say >> and says it in your voice, the more that it becomes familiar with how I talk. >> Okay. So, if you keep using this thing and chatting into it, it's going to start to pick up on sort of the way you form thoughts and your processes and manner of speaking, and it's going to actually use that when it edits. >> Yep. And it's it's just an app that operates in the background that it's just a button on any place where I have a keyboard. There's a button that I can just start and it'll just start recording. >> So if you let's say you had an idea for a blog and let's say it was like the 8020 nutrition rule or something like that and you just started like you hit that button and start talking, you could speak your thoughts into this blog and it'll reorder them and make them into a cohesive subject. >> Yeah. And readable by other people. >> That is fascinating. How much editing after the fact do you have to do? Like when it comes out, is it like A+ or what level does it >> perfect as far as I'm concerned? Uh it's perfect. >> Really? >> Yeah. >> What uh what's the cost for it per month? >> Zero. >> Is it really? >> I mean, if it was anything, it was negligible that I didn't even think twice about just downloading the app. >> Wow. Okay. So, this is a cool a cool one. So, do you use this for other things like say messaging clients, composing emails, like you said the whole thing, right? >> Yeah, I use I use it for everything. Um, except for like if the text message to someone is shorter than four words and it's someone that I can be like I don't have to spell you. I can just use the letter U. >> Like, I use it for everything other than like text messages to my significant other basically. >> So, how do I know this is the real Ryan? I need you to hold up a newspaper with today's date so I know it's you and not a bot. >> Exactly. Right. If my face wasn't frozen then it would help a whole lot. >> That's cool though. That's incredible that that can be used. So talk to me about how you integrate that with chat GPT. What's the system there? Like can you just when you're in chat GPT hit the button for whisper flow and and rattle away. >> Yes. Exactly. >> Really? >> It's just a keyboard button on any on any anywhere you would see a place to type text. You can just record your voice through whisper flow. >> Okay. So, talk to me about like what what's a recent chat GPT thing that you use this for. Can you give me an example? >> Recently, this is we're having to um submit restraining orders >> for people. And so, it's not the funnest thing to, >> but it's definitely the most recent thing. um using it to clean up the the the verbiage of all the things and then putting that into chat GBT so that it can further make me sound smarter than I actually am. >> So that's interesting. So I'm a very like I'm Oh, go ahead. Pardon me. >> Yeah. So everything I mean before the week before that it was okay, we need to build out SOPs. We just we just promoted a an employee to like a regional manager role. So, okay. So, what does regional manager do? So, we built out all the SOPs and all the roles and and all the things and I was able just to speak that into chat GPT and then chat GPT suggested some things and organized it in a way that I was just able to send it to people. >> Wow. So, this has got to be I mean, if you're not into this stuff, that's got to be like a monster timesaving and a stress saving for you. And it probably results in greater clarity. Am I right? >> Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Cuz it crews up my language and then it chat GBT formats everything in a way that uh people can understand with bullet points and making it look pretty and helps me think of things that I didn't think of uh in the first place. And so chat GBT kind of the same way. It learns me and uh the more I use it, the more it understands kind of the nuance things that I don't say it. So I don't have to say it every single time to it. uh it understands what I'm trying to do, what we're trying to accomplish, so it can help put in me missing pieces that I wouldn't have thought of myself. >> Okay. So, let me let me ask you this because I'm going to see if I can give a shortcut to gym owners for something that's like essential but kind of a pain in the ass. And that would be creating a staff playbook. And back in the day, I know people have like literally locked themselves in a hotel room for a weekend and turned off all phones and communication, not told anyone where they are and written a staff playbook to govern every aspect of their business. And they didn't painstaking detail. This is an essential found foundational task in a business. Like your business pyramid rests on f systems and procedures and if you don't document these, you can never offload Joel jobs. You can never formalize your business and you can never go on to higher value tasks. But this process kind of sucks. So could you just sit there and talk into this into Whisper Flow the ideas that you want to do and would it produce something reasonable that you could use? >> Yes, >> 100%. >> Wow. So gym owners, if you're out there and your mentor or if you don't have a mentor and I said like you get you need roles and procedures for things and you don't want to do it simply because you don't feel like typing it out, you don't want to write it, you don't want to do the bullet points, you hate Microsoft Word or whatever your your reason is, give this a try. Use this app. Ryan, is it super easy to use? Like is it kind of very intuitive and simple? >> Super easy. Yeah. >> Yeah. So that's the best part about that. If you're looking for a shortcut hack to get through something that's essential for your business, I'd highly recommend you check this out. Uh, give me another place where you might use it. Is there something else like could it could it even do like could it compose ads for you? >> Yes. Compelling copy for anything. >> So, blogs, obviously, social media posts, just literally anything you want to say. >> Anything you want to say. I'm a better communicator on videos or through just me speaking to stuff. So, it's able to translate that into written copy in a way that's better than I would ever be able to do it. And so, in the business, in every aspect of business, when there's anything copy, >> uh, it does a better job. And then outside of that, if I'm trying to be creative, it helps with all of those things, too. And it's like my little personal assistant that is >> can perfectly transcribe everything that I'm that's in my head. >> I've got a few ideas. I'm going to ask you if these are possible. And if you don't know and haven't tried this, no sweat. But I'm just curious about this. Could you, for example, let's say you had to do a presentation to a group of local business owners, could you just rattle off a first draft into Whisper Flow and have it crank out what you actually should sound like and then rehearse that script? >> Yes. >> Okay, that's cool. >> And it it will it will clean it up and make it legible. So, it won't necessarily make you So, if you took if you did your first draft >> Yep. and then took that into chat GPT and said, \"Okay, this is what I want to say and I'm saying it to this audience.\" >> Then chat GPT would spit out the script specific to the audience that you're speaking to. >> Okay. >> Um, that's how I would do that. >> Okay. Does it have the ability? Could you pump in a recording and have it analyze that? Like transcribe that and then put that into chat GPT >> right into Whisper Flow. I don't know if you could put it into Whisper Flow and it I've never tried that. >> Mhm. I imagine what you probably could do is you could play a recording and maybe with one source and record with the other one. Right. >> You could absolutely do that. >> So, we would do that. And what I'm what I'm curious about is say something like this if you were doing a a staff review or a coaching review and you wanted to like say a review a whiteboard brief that a coach gives. If you recorded what that coach said and then played it into whisper flow, might it format it better and make it more clear? >> Yes. >> Okay. So, that's fascinating. You could then probably put that into a chat GPT, ask it to make it even cleaner and more concise because you said it eliminates or whisper flow at least eliminates redundancy. So, you could really clean this thing up and then present that to the coach and say, \"This is what you said. This is how I'd like you to say it.\" Would that work? >> Yeah, you could do that for sure. >> Ah, that's interesting. How about this one? Could you do could you rehearse? And I would be very poor with this because I had trouble with these interactions. Let's say you had to tell a staff member u in, you know, a negative thing in a staff review. Could you rehearse that line, have Whisper Flow clean up your stumbling and bumbling, which I would definitely do, and then pump that into chat GPT as well to have that kick out what would be a more ideal approach to reprimanding a staff member. >> Yep, >> that would work too. I can think of about a thousand places where this could help in just about every aspect of business. And you said it's a for the low low price of $0 more or less. >> Okay. >> So listeners, check this out. We'll put a link in the show notes here. This is something that Ryan uses regularly. Chat GPT. Uh that was pretty ubiquitous at this point. I think everybody's using some version of that. Let me move on and ask you not just the specifics of those platforms, Ryan, but talk about AI syncing up with two brain business principles and the best practices for running a gym. How are you finding that that matches up with the things that your mentor is telling you to do? Well, it allows me to get more done in a shorter period of time >> where so I can get the focused highlevel stuff done um in a meaningful way and it's not eating up so much of my actual time. >> Um we can get the highlevel blog post done. we can, you know, in my golden hour, we get a whole lot more done because uh I'm not having to type out all the things. Um the few examples like trying to be more uh professional in all of the interactions >> and to make things as clear as they can be is beneficial if uh I have it get cleaned up by AI before I say things to people that is confusing or >> Yeah. >> I'm going to circle back to the golden hour that you just mentioned, but before you just gave me another idea. I imagine that if you were trying to rehearse sales scripts or objection handling or closing a sale and you're one of those people that tends to like I do repeat things and kind of dance around the issue, Whisper Flow might help you get to the point. >> Yep. >> Or and to your point, I think you could have it record yourself roleplaying something and then it would clean it up enough. It just cleaning it up what you already say naturally would help. And then you could put that into chat GP and say, \"How could I do this better?\" And then, \"Here's what I normally say. How could I say it better?\" And it would clean that whole thing up. >> And you could probably even tack onto that. Could you, you know, how like exactly what you said, plus use the sales principles reflect or laid out in this particular blog or from this expert or from, you know, general sales principles on the internet and phrase this exactly appropriately to help me close more sales and help more people. I imagine that would probably produce something amazing. >> Yeah, you could absolutely do that. >> Okay, so there's another one for you guys. If you're struggling with sales, you might want to try whisper flow and chat, GPT, a little bit of role playing and rehearsal and so forth. And even getting your speech like not being redundant and speaking very clearly and directly in a sales meeting, that's going to help you a lot. So this I mean the ROI and again the $0 spend of, you know, or even if it's 10 bucks or whatever, the ROI on that if you close five more sales in a month is is monster. So, that's just an aside as to what you might use it for. Uh, golden hour. So, golden hour is Chris Cooper's concept. I've got the book here. You're going to use 60 minutes first, usually it's the first 60 minutes of your day, focused, rigidly structured one hour to grow your business. You're going to do that before you do anything else. So, no matter what happens the rest of day, bombs go off and like you're out of toilet paper and everything's just blowing up around you, you still know that you have pushed your business forward measurably by doing one thing in the first hour of your day. Chris has it laid out in that book. I would encourage you to pick that one up on Amazon. So, if you're trying to get a lot done in an hour, obviously Whisper, anything that is that is going to speed things up for you is going to help you maximize that hour. Do you find that your golden hours got supercharged when you started using this, Ryan? >> Yes. Specifically, the ones that are where I'm having to write down stuff where >> I'm spending the time writing things or responding to things, it's just it's it's way faster. >> Yeah. And I'll give you an example and you can tell me if this is something you've done or not. Uh Chris talks about one of the things in the golden hour is do your big projects. That's the D in golden. Do your big projects. And one of those big projects might be uh create or improve a 90-day client journey. So you would sit there and you talk in your phone and just say, \"Okay, step one, you know, the lead sees my ad. Step two, the lead uh comes to my website and books an appointment.\" And you go from there all the way to 90 days of being a client. That could all be laid out just by being in your phone and you'd have that right in front of you as opposed to have to like type with you know you ever Cheers the old show where I think Sam Malone was typing with the end of a bminton racket like that's a bit of a different uh different vibe eh >> yeah absolutely it's way it just speeds all of that up. So, if you are, and again, this this someone like Chris Cooper, this might not help essentially in the sense that like he he types and reads and works in that medium, but if you're a person who doesn't enjoy typing or or putting words on paper and so forth, speaking, if you're a talker, this can be a big help. And it's a really cool way to combine I love the idea that you've got of using Whisper Flow and Chat GPT together. And again, the thing that I'm hammering away at here is that you're using AI and you can use it to speed up the the get stuff done period of your day, which is that golden hour. You can also use it to get that lower level of the business pyramid in place, which is systems and procedures, which everyone kind of hates, right? We don't like building these, you know, tedious processes and staff playbooks and roles and responsibilities. But if you don't do it, your business is a house on fire. If you do do it, you can offload everything and scale up and have much more time. You could replicate that business 17 times down the road if you wanted to in other gyms. You could apply the same principles in another field if you wanted to open a pizza shop or whatever it would be. So, this thing can really help you get through the essential stuff, the business virtuosity that maybe isn't super fun but needs to get done. Let me ask you this as we close this up. Do you have plans to scale up your AI usage? And, you know, what do you wish that it could do for you in the future? I don't know that there's much more scaling up that I could do. >> Yeah. >> For everything already. >> I haven't come across a thing that I wished it could do. >> It can do anything you ask it to. Sometimes an image that it generates is not the best image, but uh it's better than nothing. >> So there's really there's nothing I don't find myself wanting. I think there it's more powerful than what I'm even using it for. Yeah, and that's probably the point then is like maybe there isn't more that's needed. It's it's more it's like we need to use our the horsepower that's there a little bit better. And the example is uh software, gym management software. Most gym owners don't know how to use all the features that are available. Often they'll say this doesn't work. But when I ask the gym management software company, they're like, \"It totally does that, you know.\" So there's that kind of idea. We're probably just grazing the surface of what the AI stuff can do in a gym. Would you agree with that? >> Yeah, absolutely. >> Yeah. And Chris Cooper this week in the blogs on uh twobrainbusiness.com uh has a ton of great resources talking about different things uh AI things that he loves to use or he uses at his gym or he knows that people use two brain gym owners use in their gyms. He's got a list so we'll put a link to that article in the show notes as well so you guys can check those out. But in this show the highlights would be uh whisper flow and chat GPT linked together if you especially if you like to talk more than you like to write. Ryan, I really want to thank you for sharing your workflow on here and some tips on this. I think it's going to help people save time. >> Absolutely. Anytime. >> All right, we'll talk to you again soon. Thanks for listening, listeners. This is Run a Profitable Gem.

And uh if you notice when you purchased your unit, you had these two tools. And a lot of people uh thought that these tools were simply for packing your herb chamber down. That's true. But there also have other uses. Uh occasionally when you uh go to take your filling chamber out, oh, it'll get stuck and just the rubber will come out and the bowl will be, you know, firmly in place. And you're wondering, well, how the hell do I get it out? Well, that's where this threaded tool comes in. You simply apply the screw screw it in and that will allow you to pull the bowl free. Now, as for popping the screen out, second tool, you're using the smaller end. You can just put that firmly on a table. and just insert it. Pressing down. [Applause] Oops. Well, should keep an eye on it because it can go flying out. But anyway, that's it. Done. Popped out. Hope that explains"

Hey Tane, how are you buddy? >> Great to meet you, man. >> All right. Listen, we were having this conversation and you know, you've been an immigrant founder yourself. >> Yeah. >> Right. Right. And I want to just get a sense of what are the things that an immigrant founder finds, you know, maybe unfair, but you actually think it's it's not a liability. Give me a couple of things that you think are useful. >> That's actually the biggest thing. I think a lot of people have the mentality that being an immigrant is a liability and it's something that that deserves pity. But no, it's actually a superpower and it's something that I want people to be proud of. >> Okay? Because what you have as an immigrant is you are resourceful. You have gone through things over the years that have gotten you here in the first place. You have gone through a lot of people who said no to you repeatedly, but you still wanted to go past those obstacles. >> And I think that's a skill that and that's an opportunity that you have had in life that strengthens character. >> Okay. >> And the second thing immigrant immigrants have is honestly community. like there's thousands of people here right now all just to support each other >> and that's special. >> I absolutely love that. You know, one of the things that has happened to me in the last 2 months is I I moved to SF just 2 months ago and I've been posting a lot on LinkedIn and basically telling my friends and founders in India, you know, like the the AI action here is great, right? >> And what are two things you'd like to tell these founders who haven't yet booked their tickets to come to SF? what should they prepare for on this journey? >> The couple of things I'll say and this is coming from also having a lot of friends right now in India who are building companies and so I can compare and contrast. >> It is much much easier to raise funding here than it is in India and investors are way more happy to give you a lot more capital here which is fantastic. you probably see this yourself as a as a VC and even all my Indian founders are now raising from US VCs >> uh cuz it is better deals easier process all of the above and the second thing I'd say is if you are building in the space of actually pushing the frontier you're pushing the frontiers of AI you're pushing the frontiers of technology in any and always the ecosystem here actually supports you and promotes that they don't chase behind your gross margins and revenues and and all of that because what I think is unique about Silicon Valley is just the love for innovation >> and the realization that it takes it takes time and it takes energy and resources to actually build that and but that hard work is respected. >> Absolutely. I agree with you. Uh crazy anecdote, right? This founder messaged me on on LinkedIn in June that really I loved your content about coming to SF. I'm booking tickets. middle of July this person messages me that hey I'm landed can we meet >> right so it's the same day we met >> and 17 days later I get a WhatsApp update from him that beneath I've raised x million the speed here is incredible >> that's awesome this is exactly what happened 17 days yeah so thanks a lot for this man appreciate it and I'm hoping we'll catch up more in SF you're a neighbor done we'll make it happen thank you >> thank Yo."

        "srt": "Ever wish you could skip all the typing and just talk your way through emails, notes, or even code? Today, we're breaking down two tough voice dictation tools: Whisper Flow and Super Whisper. By the end, you'll know which one deserves your voice. First up, Whisper Flow. This tool is built for anyone who wants AI powered dictation that works across almost any app. Whether you are drafting an email in Gmail, coding in VS Code, or chatting on Slack, it's impressively fast, claiming speed up to four times quicker than typing. It also comes with smart extras like autoedits, tone adjustment, and support for more than 100 languages. Get unique lingo. It even lets you build a personal dictionary. Pricing starts with free plan that gives you 2,000 words per week, while the pro version at $12 per month unlocks unlimited words and advanced editing commands. On the downside, some users mention small glitches when integrating with certain systems, and the free tire can feel limiting for heavy users. Next, Super Whisper. This one's all about privacy and control. It runs completely offline, keeping everything on your device while still delivering accurate transcriptions with clean punctuation. It's a great choice for working during walks and noisy cafes or anytime you want to avoid a cloud. It can also turn your dictated notes into polished emails or documents. The free plans covers the essentials, while the pro plan at $8.49 $49 per month adds access to cloud models and translations features. The tradeoffs, the mobile app is not as polished as Visper Flows, and for longer recordings, you may find yourself wishing for a pause button. So, which one's better? If you want a deep app integration, advanced AI tools, and collaboration features, Whisper Flow is your best bet. But if privacy, offline reliability, and simplicity are more important, Super Whisper takes the crown. Either way, your keyboard might be getting a well deserved"

        "srt": "Whisper Flow versus Super Whisper. Let's start with user interface and design philosophy. Whisper Flow adopts a clean almost invisible UI where the focus is completely on flow state note takingaking. Its strength lies in reduction fraction. Everything is gesture based or smart prompted. You don't think about formating, saving or even organizing. It does all that in the background. Super Whisper, on the other hand, feels more like a studio environment for your brain. You can switch between free form voice dictation, structure, outline, and visual through mapping. While it's slightly more complex, it gives you more visual control if you are the type who likes to see your thinking laid out. Let's now look at real-time transaction and voice capture. One of the core use cases, Whisper Flow is incredibly fast. It transcribe your voice to text in mile seconds and thanks to its neural compression model. It understands poses, corrections, and even several emotion tones. You would be walking, whispering, or renting half asleep. Whisper still catches it. Super Whisper, while slightly slower in initial transcription, shines in contextual refinement. Its real-time suggestions adapt based on previous ideas, giving you narrative aware transcript that reads more like a refined first draft. Now, what about summarization and content structuring? This is where opinions split. Whisper flow uses semantic memory models which chunk your input into meaning clusters. It's great for brainstorming meeting notes and capturing train of thoughts idea. Super whisper takes a more editorial approach. It generates executive summaries, bullet insights and even meeting action plans using its contextual AI agent. If you are a student, content creator or strategies, you love super whisper clarity. If you are an artist, thinker or editor, whisper flow reserves more of your voice and nonsense. Let's talk integration and ecosystem. Whisper flow is built for solitude. It works offline sync to local encrypted storage and integrates only with core tools, notion, apple notes, obsidian and minimal cloud sync. It built to keep your mind and data private. Super whisper is more of collaborative intelligence tool. It links to Google Workspace, Slack, Trillo, Asana, and even Zoom. You can have it listen on the meeting and generate summaries in real time. If you're in team heavy workflow, Super Whisper has the age. And then there's pricing and value. Whisperflow offers a lifetime license model for one-time payment, something rare these days. Super Whisper uses tiered subscription model with free basic tier and AI enhanced pro and max plans. The pro tier gives you full AI summarization and advanced export options while Max gives you access to shared team spaces, long form voice retention and smart multispeaker separation. So whisper is ideal for solo thinkers and journaling minds while super whisper feels like an AI workplace assistant. We should also consider data ownership and privacy. Whisper flow is built around ondevice processing and end to end encryption. Your data stays with you. Super whisper stores transcript in the cloud and while it complies with major privacy regulations, it's less ideal for privacy purist or those dealing with confidential material. If you are working involve legal health or sensitive journalistic work, whisper may be safer. Next, let's go to the performance under stressed. We tested both apps in noisy environment with overlapping voices and imperfect accent. Whisper flow maintained faster baseline recognition but lack speaker separation. Super whisper cuff multi segmentation labeled speakers correctly and offered readable result even without overlapping conversation. an incredible advantage for podcaster, interviewers, and meeting heavy user. And finally, we'll consider all AI collaboration and smart prompts, super whisper include voice activated commands like summarize, disk, highlight, gate, takeaways, or convert into an email. It's like having a mini project manager in your ear. Whisper flow while more intuitive is less interactive. It waits, lessen and structures slightly. But sometimes the silence leads to better uninterrupted flow. Especially for writers, poet or creative avoiding distraction. Let's now look at how different user are adopting these tools into their daily routines. A freelancer screenwriter we interviewed described how she used whisper flow in early hours of the morning. Still groggy ideas flowing unfiltered, she speak softly into her phone, lets her thoughts unravel without judgment. And later when she fully awake, she copies the throw voice dump into her screenplays draft. She told us whisper isn't just a tool, it's my silent corriter when my conscious brain is still booting up. Ow. Contrast that with startup founder who swear by super whisper. His day is backtoback zoom meetings, pitch calls and team updates with super whisper running in background. He doesn't just get transcript. He gets task summaries, deadline pull into Asana and recap email sent out before the call even ends. To him, Super Whisper isn't just an assistant. It's business co-pilot. Whisper Flow believes is non intrusive clarity. It wants to be invisible, simless, and pure channel for inner thought. There's no AI talking back, no suggestions. Unlike ask if assumes you want to think deeply without algorithmic noise. Super whisper believes in proactive utility. It jumped in suggest summarize predict next steps. It assumes you want efficient oversolitude either is wrong but each appeals to very different headsp space. Another major factor is energy perversion. In cognitive science there's an concept called mental load drift where constant micro decisions wear you down. Whisper helps you drift inward. Super whisper helps you delegate outward. That's subtle but powerful distinction. Let's talk about export and final output. Writers love whisper row mood which outputs voice capture as untouched narrative strings perfect for creative drafts. Super Whisper meanwhile offers template exports, memos, project outline and even pitch decks. One user described it turning Kios into clarity on autopilot. Final verdec team leader, corporate worker, project manager or executive, Super Whisper is better tool. It's AI proactive, collaborative, and understands business context. It turns meetings into minutes and thoughts into task. But if you are a solute thinker, creative writer, deep worker or privacy conscious user, Whisper Flow gives you freedom. It's minimalist, private, distraction-free, and perfect for daily mental clarity. And in this final vertex, you don't need to choose one for life. You just need to know which one helps you create your best work. And that's it."

        "srt": "Hey everyone. In this video, let's do a comparison of Whisperflow and Superw Whisper. In order to do so, here we are at whisperflow.ai and we're also at superwisper.com. Let's take a look at them here just to see exactly what we're dealing with with both of them. Don't type, just speak. the voice to text AI that turns speech into clear, polished writing in every app. And you can come here to download it for Windows. It's also available on Mac, Windows, and iPhone. Write faster in all your apps on any device. Seamless speech to text in every application on your iPhone or computer. Four times faster than typing. After 150 years of using the same keyboard voice that actually works is finally here. When you create code and respond faster, you free up time for more. Speak naturally at the speed you think and let Flow handle the rest. So essentially, if you're looking for an advanced transcript taker, then Flow might be Whisper Flow might be the option for you. Now, it's referred to here as flow, but the website is whisperflow.ai. So, but they keep on referring to it as flow. So, maybe we'll just go ahead and call it that. Uh, flow for accessibility. Your voice deserves a shortcut. Flow supports anyone who feels slowed down by a computer by turning speech into structured, polished text quietly, reliably, naturally. And you can scroll down here to see more about the app. But let's go ahead and take a look at the pricing cuz that's always important. And let's look at the monthly. So we do have a free tier 2,000 words per week and lightning voice, lightning fast voice typing, etc., etc. The first tier of the subscription starts at 100 uh excuse me $15 not $150 $15 a month. So you get to use all the features, everything in basic unlimited words, command mode for editing, prioritize feature requests, early access to new features, unlimited mobile usage, and then there's the teams and the enterprise solution. So depending on who this is for, if it's for you or you have a team here, $12 a month per user. So if you're using this for teams, then it's $12 per month. Let's go ahead and take a look at well, let's go ahead and go to the download option here really quick. I just want to make sure. So it wants us to sign in. Okay. And this is what I was looking for. Just want to make sure where Flow is available. It's available on Mac. It's not available for web, but you can get notified and you can vote if you want to build it for Android and for Linux. So, let's take a look at Super Whisper. And with Super Whisper, we are looking at pretty much the same thing. The difference is that it is most likely exclusively for Mac. So, let's see here. So yeah, if you want to download it, then you can put your email in there and hit download there. I have no reason to believe that it's not available that that it is available on Windows. So if you're a Mac user and you're looking for something that is tailorade for a Mac, you might want Super Whisper. But if you are a PC user, then you might want to head over to whisperflow.ai. Let's see here if we can find anything related to the pricing. And here we go. So, you can get the free version and seems as though it says unlimited use of small voice models. So, you might want to check that out. For the pro version, you can it's uh $8.49 US and you get everything in free. Plus, you can use your own API keys, unlimited use of cloud and local AI models, transcribe anything into English, transcribe audio and video, and priority support. So, pretty reasonable there with the subscription payment. If you are interested in Super Whisper and you're a Mac user, head over to superw whisper.com. And if you are a PC user, you may want to take a look at Whisperflow AAI instead. And that's all there is to it. If you found this video helpful, please leave a comment and like and subscribe.

I've been testing this AI powered dictation app and is seriously impressive, letting you speak instead of type up to four times faster. Let's break it down. Whisper Flow is a voicetoext tool that works across any app on your Mac, Windows, or iPhone. Just hit a hotkey, start talking, and watch your words appear. polished, formatted, and ready to go. It's not just basic dictation, though. Flow uses AI to autoedit your rambles into clear sentences, adapts tone for different apps, casual and Slack, professional and emails, and even learns your unique vocabulary. Plus, it supports over 100 languages, which is a gamecher for multilingual users. What really stands out, command mode. You can literally tell Flow to rewrite, shorten, or tweak your text hands-free. And if you're in a quiet space, whisper mode lets you dictate without disturbing anyone. For Teams, there's shared context and admin controls, while students get a sweet 50% discount. Now, the trade-offs. The free plan caps you at 2,000 words a week, fine for light use, but heavy users will need the pro plan at $12 a month or 15 depending on the page. consistency isn't their strong suit. And while accuracy is solid, you'll still need to tweak the occasional slip up. So, who's this for? Writers, coders, students, or anyone who thinks faster than they type? If you're done with keyboard fatigue, Whisper Flow is a slick, powerful upgrade. Just don't expect perfect transcription yet. For the speed boost alone though, totally worth a"

        "srt": "Imagine this. You're thinking your thoughts out loud and you're just watching it being written, edited, and polished all in front of your face. This is what this software that I'm about to show you guys allows you to do. And this has been an absolute game changer for me and how I just work on my computer in general. And I really want to show you guys cuz I know it can help so many of you. So, as you guys can see on my screen today, I'm going to be using Whisper Flow. After using this for about a month and already using over 20,000 words, I can confidently say that this has sped up literally everything that I do. Whether that be messaging, whether that be emailing, whether that be even just writing things down and interacting with chat bots in general. Now, when you first see this, you're going to probably be like, \"Yeah, you know, there's dictation. I've used dictation before.\" It's basically where you click the mic and then you speak and then it writes the text out for you. So, this is essentially that, but much, much better. And let me show you guys exactly why. For example, when I'm on Chad GBT and just normally talking, obviously, the way that you prompt and talk to an AI is just as good as the result that you're going to get back. So, it's worth that you actually give it a good input. And what's really useful about this is that whenever you speak into it, it fixes up your grammar. It fixes up your punctuation. So that way it organizes all the errors that you have and make sure that the AI is understanding everything that you're saying. So let me give you guys an example. I just want to talk about how good this software is and how much it's actually helped me. And um I also want to talk about how using different AI tools speeds up your workflow much faster. So, as you can see, in an instant, it automatically put down my answer here into the chatbot. Obviously, this is Chad GBT. So, you know, you can just use it as is. It also helps you write emails. It also helps you write messages. You can also use it on your phone. So, let's just say, for example, I'm just drafting any email, right? I can go here. I go to Gmail and be like, write an email to this person telling them that I'm going to meet with them next week. So, you can see how fast it's writing down things. And honestly, this has been such a game changer because, you know, typing things, it's good. And I know a lot of you guys out there probably type super fast. But if you're anything like me, you have so many ideas in your mind that you just want to get out into the computer or you want to get out. And sometimes writing can be a little bit slow, especially cuz you're going to make errors. You're going to hit backspace a couple times. This tool allows you to actually just use your voice and just get your ideas out faster and communicate with your computer faster. And for me, this has been such a game changer. Even in my messaging, like I don't waste as much time writing things down. Get it straight into your computer and that's it. Also, if you're a developer, I know this is one of the biggest things. It's also context aware. So, if you're using a platform like Cursor, it's syntax smart context aware, you know, and it just makes your workflow overall just much more seamless. Obviously, the name of the software is called Whisper Flow. And the really cool thing about it, and some of you guys are going to find this weird, but you can literally whisper into your thing. So, let me show you an example and how this works. and maybe you know you're in bed at night, you don't want to make too much noise or whatever the case may be, right? This is how it works and it does a really good job. So, I'm going to be whispering into this and I'm going to do like an ASMR kind of style. I know this shit's pretty weird, but I just want to show them how good this software is. As you can see, it perfectly did that. And honestly, if there's music playing in the background, it's still going to do a great job. Sometimes it'll mess up like very very little times. But compared to normal dictation and everything else that you know that's out there right now, this is definitely killing the game right now. And even if let's say for example you're a Spanish speaker and you're trying to speak English and then you just like hand off the rest of the conversation to Spanish, it'll actually fix up your grammar and actually put it in English for you as well. And you can give it context. You can build a dictionary on yourself. There's so many different things that the software does. As you can see here, it's already building a dictionary on the things that I can say and it builds shortcuts for anything that you need. So, let's say for example, like you know, this is my email. Then you can, you know, add a snippet. I haven't done this yet, but you can say, okay, here's my personal email. And then you can give it your entire personal email. So, you can just save so much more time communicating overall. So, now I'm about to go outside real quick and just use it how I'm normally using it and show you how it makes everything just so much quicker. So, basically, I'll just use it like this. Yo, what's good, bro? How you doing? So, you can see how fast it goes. Instantly just sends the message instantly just get my idea out. And I'm having my brother reply to me right now. And as you can see, he's going to take much longer than I do. I'm good. I'm just recording a video right now on Whisper Flow. I just want to show people how fast this is and how quickly you can get a thought out. Already done. Boom. And sent. So, imagine when I say four times faster. You know, when I I tell people like this makes you four times faster. It really does because it's just like how fast it is when you're typing on your phone or even when you're just using your keyboard, like it takes a good amount of time, especially if you're not as techsavvy. It's going to take you super long time. You can just dictate and say anything that you want. It's going to fix up your grammar and you can make mistakes and um it just helps you overall. I did that. I'm on purpose and by the time I said that, it's already done. So, you guys can see how powerful this is. You know, it can help you writing your emails. It can help you sending messages. Just really everything that you do in your day-to-day life is going to be very beneficial and I recommend it to everyone, which is why I'm showing you guys this tool. So guys, I know this was a very short video, but I've been using this tool for about a month now. And I wanted to make sure that it's actually helping me before I share it to you guys, which is why it took a little bit longer for me to share it. But overall, this tool has been such a game changer. And whether you're a student, an entrepreneur, it doesn't matter what you do and who you are, this tool is going to speed you up so much. It's going to fix your grammar. It's going to make you overall faster at communicating. And what you'll notice is that as it fixes up some of your sentences whenever you mess up, you kind of get better at doing it yourself when you actually do type. So overall, it's a very beneficial software. But yeah, that's going to be it for this video, guys. It's a super short one. If you end up using it, download it and comment below using Whisper Flow. I want to see how you guys like it and what you guys think. Subscribe to the channel if you haven't already, and I'll see you guys in the next"

The startup's founder and CEO, Tan Kotari, started building Whisper to create a device that would allow users to type just by mouthing words silently. Its prior funding was for that business. Last year, the company instead started focusing on Whisper Flow, the software interface designed for the hardware device. The company released a Mac app in October 2024, followed by a Windows app in March 2025 and an iOS app earlier this month. Kotari mentioned that since its early release, VCs in Silicon Valley have been using the product. I think every single tier 1 venture fund in the valley uses Whisper Flow for their emails, memos, documents, and more. They feel themselves being hooked on it, and it is one of the products they use every day. Because of this, we started getting a lot of inbound, Qotari said about investor interest. Notably, Granola also had a similar story of receiving immense investor interest because VCs use their product a lot. Qatari also noted that the startup will soon achieve profitability at the current rate of growth and initially he didn't want to raise money. However, he worried that big tech players with a massive distribution advantage could be a risk to the company. He wanted to rapidly multiply the company's revenue and reach and decided to take the investment. Menllo Venture CEO Matt Craning, who has been an avid user of the app, said that his initial thesis for whisperflow was that with the current set of input methods like keyboards, we are waiting for our thumbs to catch up with our thoughts. Whisper Flow is creating an efficient way to translate digital thoughts and intent. The app captures users speech and what they want to convey very well. The team has thought about how people speak while developing models rather than focusing on things like word error rates, he told Techrunch. The startup said that the app has been growing its user base by 50% month overmonth. Kotari noted that 40% of users of the app are in the US, 30% in Europe, and 30% in other parts of the world. In addition, more than 30% of the app's users are from a non-technical background. More and more people are using AI tools, but still there isn't a good interface for people who are not techies. ChatGBT style interface is the most common one and that was released 3 and 1/2 years ago. We are building for all kinds of users so they don't have to write system prompts to interface with AI. Qotari said at the moment, Whisper Flow supports dictation in 104 languages. Qotari said that 40% of dictations are in English and 60% of them are in the rest of the languages with Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Hindi and Mandarin being the top languages. The company will use the funding to grow its team of 18 with roles in engineering and go to market. It will also release an Android app and cater to enterprise users by setting up companywide phrase context and support teams. The startup is working on building flow into a product that is akin to an AI powered assistant that knows more about your personal context and helps you do everyday tasks like send messages, take notes, and set reminders. Plus, the company said it's working with some AI hardware partners, without naming them, to power the interaction layer."

        "srt": "Please join us in welcoming Sam. Sahaj. Michelle, Jeffrey. Nick and Bryan. Welcome. I'm wondering if everyone in the crowd is a little bit gassed. It's been quite the day. But glad you guys want me to this last panel. And really excited to be here  with you all today. You know, like Jordan, our founder, was talking about at the beginning of the conference today,  two years ago, this Voice AI that we're discussing today it didn't exist. And I remember meeting Jordan last summer, and he walked me through kind of some of his customers and a lot of them were AI girlfriends and just really early adopter type technology. And here we are today talking about the frontiers of Voice AI in the enterprise with real world applications. So I'm excited to have these founders here on this panel today, who are all building companies that are at the frontier of Voice AI in different industries. By way of introduction, I'm Bryan, I lead the go-to-market team here at Vapi. Vapi is an enterprise platform for configuring and deploying agents in the enterprise. But this panel is not about Vapi, and it's not about me. I'm just here to orchestrate a conversation with these folks who can help you guys as entrepreneurs and engineers, understand where is Voice AI today? What are the real world use cases that are working in production? What are some of the frontier technical challenges that we're facing to scale this technology? And where is this all headed and what does it mean for us as consumers, as patients and as engineers looking to build the next big businesses? So I'm excited to announce and introduce Sam from Delphi, and they're building the, always on living profile for you or your business. And I'll tell you a little bit more about that in a minute. Jeff, from the Assort Health, they're building a patient engagement platform using AI agents. Sahaj from Wispr Flow. They built one of the first breakthrough consumer applications in the  Voice AI space. We have Michelle who's building Medra. They're one of the first to build the robotics and the physical space for drug discovery. And Nick co-founder CTO of Zocdoc, one of the most well known patient. Excuse me, one of the most well known healthcare platforms of the last several decades. So several. I'm not that old. But correct me, before the panel, I said one decade is that it's actually two decades. But thanks for the correction. But yeah, just to kick it off, I wanted to give each of these founders an opportunity to introduce themselves in their business. So we're start with you, Sam. Tell us more about what you're building. I am, as Bryan said. First of all, thank you for the generous introduction. Everybody, co-founder CTO of Delphi, working on building your always on living profile lets you create a digital mind that learns how you think and speak. And I think in years from now, people ask the question, everybody has a profile, whether it's LinkedIn, Instagram, or Facebook. But why have a static one when you can have a dynamic one that people can interact with? So we we've been using voice for a couple of years now and excited for all the questions Bryan is gonna ask. Yeah, I'm just curious, do you have any kind of for the for the audience today? Like, any examples of real world applications that you're seeing in production today that you can now share about your business? Yeah, so I think probably the best one is to talk about someone that a lot of people here know. Lenny Rachitsky, who is a Substack author. If you go to lennybot.com, you can see he has a Delphi profile and you can interact with the ask questions. And it's trained on all of his podcast and Substack articles. Schwarzenegger. is another person who uses Delphi. You put his Delphi profile inside of his weightlifting app for his community, and there's thousands of people right now who are using it. And so if you're interested in creating one for yourself, because I think in the future everyone will have one. You can go on to delphi.ai/pricing  and you can join our waitlist. And we're gonna be onboarding people, off the free tier waitlist over the next couple weeks. Awesome. Thanks, Sam. Sahaj, tell us more about what's Wisper Flow. Thanks so much for having us, having all of us here. It's really a pleasure. I'm Sahaj,  co-founder CTO at Wispr Flow. What we're building is the first voice interface for consumers that they trust more than their keyboard and mouse. And that all starts with voice dictation that you can use everywhere on your laptop and your mobile device. So you click into any text box you speak how you would to a friend, and that understands you perfectly right what you would have typed up. And the magic is that it's automatically formatted, automatically structured things that you can immediately use for communication gets names right in emails because it uses context of what's around you. But to tag files, if you're dumping long props in a cursor or ChatGPT And the key here is voice dictation builds this really strong habit of being able to trust voice and use it everywhere across your computer, and it creates this foundation for us of thinking about, hey, what are all the ways in which people want to interface with their computer using voice? What are the ways that we can keep people from being stuck staring at their screens all the time, and we're just focused on building those consumer habits one step at a time. Thanks Sahaj. Michelle, tell us more about Medra. For sure. Yeah. So we built Medra because we believe that AI is really changing the biology and drug discovery landscape. There are a lot of people right now building biology foundation models. There are a lot of people building frontier models or even AI scientists, but a big missing piece in the biology landscape is actually the data necessary to generate, the training for these models. So we are building the physical AI robotics platform that can vastly a thousand x, even 10.000 x the amount of data, that's currently available by running experiments at scale. We've also been building a reasoning AI, a scientific reasoning AI that actually allows us to take the data that we generate with our robotics platform and actually help our customers optimize, their results and improve their results. And voice is a really exciting platform for us because we are primarily working with scientists, scientists who don't want to code, who wants to talk with their colleagues about what experiments to run. We primarily focus on natural language as an input, but voice has become something that we're testing and, allowing our customers to use more and more as a way for them to actually interact very naturally with our systems. Great. Thank you. Jeff, tell us a little bit more about Assort Health. Yeah. Great to meet everyone. Thanks for having me. I'm Co-Founder and Co-CEO of a Assort Health. You know, at Assort Health., we're building the most comprehensive patient experience platform powered by our specialty specific AI agents. So that's a lot of buzzwords. But what this really means is, you know, when you call the doctor, instead of waiting on hold or dealing with confusing phone free system, we'll pick up on the first ring to schedule your appointment end-to-end and triage to the right physician. Refill your medication, whatever it may be. And now we're also doing a lot of outbound calls to really help, close care gaps and make, you know, all of us better consumers of health care. We're multimodal as well. So, you know, texting, chat bots. But voice is still our primary medium. Awesome I'm excited to take in a little bit more on that. Nick I think most of people in the room know about Zocdoc But tell us a little bit more about what you're working on these days. Yeah, sure. These are such, like, well-rehearsed, pitches that I don't I don't, I haven't done that. There's more of a circuit. So for so long, so I don't know. So, Zocdoc, for those of you who don't know, is a online platform for, searching and booking doctors, you can, you know, search by your location in your insurance carrier and, you know, see photos and read reviews, and then you can click a time and book online. So and then that's been our core business for, we just had our 18th birthday. So, it's like, it's been, quite a while since this beard is very white now. And then, but then a couple of years ago, I began tinkering with, the voice tools at the time and saw that this was, you know, a very promising situation. This is like spring of 23. So, I was like, we have all these doctors on board already. We know they're, you know, integrated to their schedules and we already know all the insurance they accept and all this. So, why don't we make a voice agent, that also answers their inbound calls and can, schedule and what not for them. So, we started that in 23, and off to the races. It's it's, you know, it's doing great. It's exciting. Yeah. That's why we put this panel together today. These are some of the founders who have built businesses that already have production grade, voice agents out in the wild doing hundreds of millions of interactions. And I'm sure a lot of people in the crowd are wondering, how did you get there and what were some of the challenges? So I wanted to start there and just ask a group kind of an open forum. Feel free to jump in. Just what are some of the hardest blockers that you faced as you not only establish your kind of voice agents, but also then scale them, to, you know, millions or hundreds of millions of interactions. I feel like I have two insights that we've learned over the last couple of years. I think people here will find it interesting. The first one is that especially for other people on the panel who are talking about how they have multimodal ways to interact with their product, oftentimes the system and the latency requirements are different between voice and text. When you're waiting for a text response, sometimes the amount of time you're willing to wait is a little bit longer than on a voice call, where the gap between when you stop talking and when you hear the response needs to be almost instant, or else it goes into this uncanny valley, which means that the amount of operations, the retrieval, whatever you want to do to enrich the context, to give a response on voice is sometimes less than what you can do over text. And so for Delphi, when you ask people on their profile, a question, the system that you use for voice is actually slightly different than the one on text, and it uses less operations or some shortcuts we have to make so that it can meet the latency requirement. But a super interesting insight that we learned is that people actually sometimes prefer the one you could say is quote unquote dumber, simply because it's through voice. And I think that people are so emotionally responsive to hearing the voice of another human, that sometimes it's not even as important what it is saying. And I think a simple experiment to test this is like, think about the movie “Her”. You can remember clearly the voice from the movie, but you can't remember a single thing that was said in the movie. And so I think for some of these voice products, it really matters way more that you have dialed down. How does the voice sound? And that's why most of the feedback we get is, oh, they pronounce this name wrong. Not that the words are actually bad. So that's one thing that I would say for anyone who's building production scale applications, like the voice quality is actually one of the most important things. And then the other thing that's been super interesting over the last year or two, and I also love to hear the opinion of some of the people on this panel is a year and a half ago, people were talking about how real time voice agents were going to completely overtake using cascading architecture. And cascade architecture is you have a transcriber, you speak, it turns it into text, and then you send it to a model and then the model gives a response. Then you send it to a synthesizer and then you get the voice. It sounds like a lot. And now with OpenAI and some of these other providers, you can just like you and you can just send audio and get audio back. So I was like, oh, that makes the most sense. That's what you should use. But it turns out that actually that is still not really the best for a lot of use cases. And you even have companies like Assembly, releasing speech to text models, and so they're investing significant amounts of research into still doing this, even though voice to voice has come out. And I have been a customer Vapi for two years. And so I even did diligence calls for their series A last year. And I remember every single call. People were saying, well, voice to voice comes out well Vapi have a business? And it turns out that even a year later, the adoption rate of voice to voice on VAPI, I think it's like single percentage or something. And so that's another thing, I think for anyone who's using voice agent to think about is in the next year or two, where is voice to voice versus speech of text going to be, and what makes the most sense for your business? So I think that those are two interesting insights. Nice. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. I was going to follow on with Sam, I think voice to voice right now, like the minute latency gains that you get are not worth the trade off of hallucinations, especially in the healthcare industry. You know, we have a huge patient safety and performance layer where we have to intercept things that are said incorrectly. It's very dangerous, right? If we're telling the patient the wrong thing. But I do think that in the future, when you with the cascading architecture, you lose a lot of bandwidth from the speech to the text. Right? Emotion, all these other factors that if you're talking to a person like, you know, I think that is really the biggest part that's missing is you lose so much going from speech to text. But I think, you know, companies like Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Cartesia ElevenLabs, Vapi, you know, all these companies are working towards a space where it can make it really safe and still have these like emotions, other things that are not passed from just purely, you know, all the stuff that's lost from speech to text, I think will be a big part of what's coming, in the next year. Yeah. It's been so interesting seeing that to solve that problem, I thought that we were just gonna use audio to audio, but instead people are saying, oh, let's put a emotion metadata on the speech to text. And people are now trying to enrich the cascading architecture more. I totally agree with you that layer of being able to see what the response is going to be, I think, is what ends up being the most important thing. Yeah, yeah. I think even for us, we really try and optimize per patient. Right? So if we can detect that a patient is speaking slowly, we can then tune down the voice of our agent automatically, right. Just like a person would. What's really nice with our outbound agents is that we have all this metadata where we understand this is a Medicare aged patient. We're going to use a different tone, a different, you know, we might make the end of turn detection longer because they might pause more, or they may be like, give them more time to say their Medicare number. So these are all things that we're able to do with outbound and be really great. You know, if we could adopt this into inbound when you don't have that metadata I'd be super curious to hear what Zocdoc does. I think one of the things that has actually been, surprisingly, one of the hardest problems in AI over the last couple of years, we're like, okay, we solved LLMs and all of these insane, and we're doing drug discovery. But it turns out the most challenging thing is knowing when someone's done talking. Yeah. Yeah. So obviously there's I mean the whole day has been about end of thought right. End of turn detection. Yeah. And so I actually worked with Dylan a lot on Assembly he's in New York and I'm in New York and, I spent many hours in the Assembly offices telling them, like, end of turn, end of turn, give me end of turn. And then they did it, and it's great. They they, have had it for a few months now. I think the way to, take, a little bit of a different take on this. There's like, many layers of problems. I'd say. So like the first layer is just like voice, you know? Like, how do you interrupt? How do you, you know, know how long to wait? And there's a lot of clever stuff you can do, like, you know, understand the the speed of the of the caller and all this kind of stuff. And then there's, like and then once you sort all that out, then you have all these, like, domain specific problems in your domain. I was talking to Jordan yesterday, you know, and I was like, okay, we sorted all this out. Let's say it's all perfect, right? And somebody calls and they're like, I want to make an appointment, doctor's appointment. And we go, great, what insurance do you have? And they go, Blue Cross. Well, okay. There's like 40 Blue Crosses, right. And, and the way we designed our system was like, you know, I thought we were so smart. We're like, okay, if they say, like a partial match, that would just ask them what the other ones are. So if they say United we go, like, is the United Health Care or is it like United Auto Workers because they have their own specific plan and that works great. But the first person they call in one Blue Cross, it was like, Blue Cross, Blue Shield of Georgia,  Blue Cross, Blue Shield of Texas, Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California,  Anthem Blue Cross, Empire Blue Cross? Right. I was like, oh fuck. Right. Like, like this is going to be this is going to be harder than I thought. Right? So So you know, it's been it's been a journey and that, you know, Oh. Also then Jordan was like, they tried to do Pizza Hut. I think he talked a little bit about this, but he was like, I was like, how could that be hard? Like, I have a hard problem. You don't have a hard problem. People call, they want a pizza. Like, how hard can that be? And he's like, there's infinite permutations. There's like a sale that they, whatever that, physical restaurant is out of pepperoni now, right? And the humans, like, walking around the kitchen. No, it's out of pepperoni. So if you call and they go pepperoni, they go, no, we're out of pepperoni. But how does the the machine in the cloud know that this, that there's no more physical pepperoni in this physical kitchen. These are the problems we need to be solving. Sorry? These are the problems we need to be solving. Yeah, yeah. Get more pepperoni. More pepperoni. So so, you know, there's many layers, like, you have to get through the level of, of, like, voice interaction and interruption and turn taking just to get to the next layer of, like, domain specific problems. I mean, that's been I also feel like I saw this tweet where someone is saying, we gave you self-driving cars and you wanted Spotify, and I don't know if you want to take in Waymo, but it was so frustrating you couldn't play your own music. That I like, it degraded my experience. And you forget you're in a self-driving car. And I think it's some of the same where you forget, oh, I can call any business any time, and I can book a doctor's appointment, but. Oh, you don't know that you're on pepperoni. What the hell? I think one of the other things interesting is it seems like a better way to consume information is to read it. But a better way to give information is to speak it. And so I also be interested about Wispr Flow,  where it seems like there's a almost like a future where you want a mix of both because it's faster depending on what you're trying to do. Yeah. I mean that's exactly right. That's also why we're so focused on voice dictation as a starting point instead of voice assistants that are two-way or back and forth for most consumers. One of the biggest problems that we deal with, which is kind of related to everything that people hear we're talking about, is like, how many times have people used a voice interaction and like, seen the output and been like, wow, how the hell did it think I said that? And it's like complete gibberish because you know, the topic that you're talking about, you know, what you normally talk about, you know what's on the screen. You're replying to an email to a person named Bryan with a Y. You know, of course it should be spelled Bryan with a Y. And this is probably I'm curious to hear from others if this is challenging in their domains respectively, where there's like nonsensical voice outputs because these models don't have context around what's the topic people are talking about. What are they doing right now? Why is it important to them? What is this person's accent like, and how does that kind of change all of the different words that they're saying? And when you're using voice for communication, for sending slack messages, emails, texts, it's actually really important to get every single word right, which like is surprisingly key. And so like that's why again, like what we focus on is just voice in, text out. But get it right every time so that you never have to edit the output of your interaction and like, don't say it back to the user, right? Just let them see it, let them read it, let them confirm it themselves. And as people build trust again after like 25 years of being told that like voice interactions are going to be the thing they use for their phone and their laptop, then like rebuild that trust, then start to add more and more interactions on top of it. I think, one thing the Sam you just talked about is like, how do you actually mix the different modalities? It sounds like most people here are like it's either voice or then it's like text based agent. Whereas for us we actually mix both of them together. Right? Like we primarily use text base as input. So scientists can like have a PDF of their protocols they upload it. We can understand it. And then we translate that into some like visual flow of what their science is. Where we think voice is actually really important is actually that real time interaction. Let's say our physical AI platform is doing something you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're actually doing that wrong. Like that's not quite how I would do it. Like can you tweak it? That's where we want to bring voice in. Whereas text is incredibly important for that first understanding. And I actually think because we use text so much already, it helps us get around a lot of problems we're talking about because primarily we have a lot of, we're primarily thinking of it as like text based agents. And so there's a lot of already structure in place and a lot of context in place with the text that we're generating for our robots to understand. And so the voice can really just be like a supplemental of, like, how do I actually make this really easy to interact with real time? Because you wouldn't want to like, stop, you know, like that's too long, but you want to like, talk to it. But then when you have much longer, let's say you actually want to make multiple changes. You also wouldn't want to read through all the changes. You wouldn't want to make. You want to go back to text like, hey, it's kind of like with the humans, like, oh, let me just slack you the changes I want to make if it's long, but I can tell it to you if it's short. So how can we mix that together? I think it's really a user experience interaction problem that if you can get it right, can make that, can make using both voice and text a lot more seamless. Totally. I think another interesting thing you touched on briefly just now is you're saying, like once you rebuild that trust. I remember Jeff when we first met, we had dinner, we were talking about this is a particularly important for you because people are so used to when they're interacting with something that having to do with health care. They're like, get me to a human right now. And I, I think there's probably some barrier where once you overcome it, people are going to be the opposite. They're like, I want to call this business and I want to get an answer instantly. I don't want to talk to someone who does understand me, and I just want to be able to have it, have the tools. Do you feel like we're close to that barrier? Yeah, that's that's totally true. Even if I called in, I think a lot of patients have an experience with your credit card company, your airline, like, you know, kind of worse AI agents. Right? Like, I think one of the coolest parts of what I've been able to do is, you know, we're here in San Francisco. I think that if you travel to other parts of the world, like the clinics that we work with and, you know, we work with these, you know, rural, you know, Medicaid populations in the middle of nowhere, they don't even have like, it's only landlines, right? So there is a great distrust for this type of technology, which once you meet people you totally understand. So I think for us it's really about gaining trust Hey, if you want to be transferred, will actually transfer you. But hey, while you're waiting on hold, why don't you, instead of listening to this hold music, you can talk to our AI agent. And once another person is ready, you can either continue or you can get transferred. So I think that's really the only way to build trust. When we onboard our clinics, we send them patient education materials. Right. And we really emphasize that piece like this is just an alternative path. You can always still speak to a person if you want to. So I think that's extremely important. But obviously, you know, we're doing what we're doing because we're very bullish that trust over time in voice AI agents will increase. For the most part, you know, we really always say, “Hey, I'm Amy, I'm a virtual assistant on behalf of X practice”,  or they get to choose the name. So we always like to reveal that because they don't want to feel tricked. Right. So I think that's been really huge focus of ours is now a process. Now, you know, 43 million patient reactions were rated over 4.5 out of 5, when a human, you know, on average is only rated at 3.8, 3.9 out of 5. And I think a lot of that is about being transparent, building that trust, not trying to trick people into thinking you're a person, when you're not. Because I don't think I think you could probably get away with that for 2 minutes. But, you know, the length of our convos are what, you know, they can extend up to 7 minutes. These are complicated calls. And, you know, even a, you know, you people will realize. So we don't want to do that. I think health care is a little bit easier than maybe other industries because, everyone's called a doctor and been put on hold forever, right. And so like, so I think we have a bit of a more willing it to, try it demographic because they know if they go transfer me that they might have like a 30 minute hold time. Really? Yeah. That's definitely one of the hardest challenges for us, which is you're trying to build a habit that or break a habit that people have had for their entire lives, which is typing on a keyboard, and a mental model that they've had their entire life, which is speaking instead of typing, is going to lead to more mistakes and be more cumbersome and be awkward and painful. And it's the kind of interaction that's delightful when it works and kind of annoying when it doesn't. And so if it doesn't work every single time, the habit doesn't stick. And so, like one of the questions that we often get are like, how are you different from the other people building voice dictation? And it's actually really hard to give a good answer. Besides, people stick around and then continue to build the habit more and more over time because it actually works. And it's like such a uninspiring answer to give. But at the end of the day, that's the thing that will like slowly shift behavior, slowly get people to stick around where otherwise like it might make a mistake here and there. Like you mention, one that makes a mistake on like names when you're responding to people in an email. Like if it gets that wrong every time, you're just going to stop using it. Unlike in healthcare, where like, medical dictation has been such a key part of doctors practices for like 20 years, because if you have three hours of notes to take a day, you have no choice but to use some kind of voice tool. I'm curious, just kind of building on that topic of adoption and building habits. I'm curious if any of you, well, just a backstory, I guess. When I joined Vapi, we spent about half of our conversations just trying to convince people that Voice AI was here, and it's real and that's no longer the case, I think people understand that. But I'm curious if what you're seeing in your different industries and businesses, like, do you see any specific upcoming events or things that will help accelerate adoption of Voice AI, or any sort of barriers that exist that could be broken through to accelerated adoption? I think this is like a normal adoption curve of like any new tech. Certainly it's like coming to fruition much faster, like it's getting better much faster than the previous, you know, sort of step changes of like PC and then internet and mobile. The pace of this is just unbelievable, but humans have to adopt it. Right. And so like and that still happens. That right. There's still Homo sapiens, the same Homo sapiens that we were during the PC revolution or the internet revolution. So like, so that that bell curve is still going to happen. But you can see it like, 100% working, like if you guys, you know, \"Crossing the Chasm\", if you guys read \"Crossing the Chasm\", this is such an old book that nobody knows. Okay. So I think this is very straightforward, crossing the chasm where there's like, the early adopters that we all have now, that are clients and they're excited to use it, and then we're just at this chasm moment now where it's like, you know, the people on the other side of the chasm are like looking at the early adopters, and they're like, oh, this is working like, this is awesome. And so I think we're just right at the cusp of, like, a massive uptick. And, you know, we're all here next year. And there's just going to be, it's going to be like a no brainer, right? Nobody has to argue about whether voice agents are here or not. Out of curiosity, how many people here we could do this if I get invited back next year or two? How many people here have a voice agent in, like, production right now? Just show of hands. Awesome. Wow. And that's a lot. That's awesome. That's crazy. I thought it would be, like, six. Let's try it next year. But everybody's already got a conference. Awesome. I mean, that's okay. That's good. I was going to ask to start test volumes, but I think people probably keep that close to the chest. But, yeah. It feels like the adoption is right on the cusp of just massive. Yeah. I think one of the things that's going to accelerate the most is hardware adoption, where, you know, whatever is going to come out of IO next year, it's supposed to be something that has to do with using voice and technology is like visage building, where people just start to build this habit, where they arrive at something and they just expect that they should be able to talk to it. And I think something that a lot of people, you know, we talk about how we're in SF and we're in a bubble and we don't know what's going on. I think one of the things that sometimes people don't think about is what kids are doing, and really the people who are growing up being, you know, gaining sentience, right as ChatGPT has come out and never knowing anything else other than that. And they can press the button, they can get the voice, the omniscient presence that can tell you anything they know, nothing different. I think some people forget that. And so those people five, ten years from now, they're just going to expect that anything they land on, they just ask a question and then get an instant answer in, you know, voice, text, video, whatever modality they want. And so I think that's one thing that you'll see is a bunch of them come online in high school and college. And then another thing is all these technology as hardware. You just start to expect that that's how you can use it. I think Sam, just, interesting tidbit I learned recently of how they introduced cat coffee into Japan was, you know, it's a big tea society. So what they did was they started advertising, like I think it was like Nestle or some like big like whatever multinational company. Big Coffee. Yeah. Yeah. Started, advertising like cartoons where these kids were eating like, you know, coffee flavored candy. And then they started selling coffee flavored candy because the kids would want them, because they saw the ads. And then when they became grown ups, you know, the taste of coffee brings back the memory of childhood. So it was literally like a 15 year old, 15 year kind of process for a customer acquisition. But, you know, it literally work. Now, the the biggest Starbucks in the world is that was just opened in Tokyo. So I totally agree that, like the I mean, I don't think it's going to take 15 years for AI agents. I also think just bringing it back specifically to health care, even for our, health systems, is directly, you know, having conversations with the CEO of Stanford Health Care, Cleveland Clinic. There's there's three major problems in health care right now. Right? Lower reimbursements, a lot of political stuff, like the big beautiful bill that's going to kind of screw over health systems and huge admin costs. Right? There's so much overhead in health care. Right? And I think, you know, of sort, what we're doing is trying to reduce that overhead where you can really one person can now do in sentences or, you know, with our new platform, what used to take hundreds of hours to do, so really empowering health care workers to be more and more effective, the second problem is that there is, you know, we're currently short 50.000 primary care physicians in the US. And I'm sure if you've tried booking, with a MD, you know, there's these appointments are months out. I've only there was some way to find a doctor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And then, the third point is, you know, there's an explosion of medical knowledge, right? So every six months, the amount of medical leave, you know, these journals double, so I think this is also a pro tip. I just found out from a friend of mine that if you're getting your wisdom teeth removed, you can actually store your stem You can get stem cells from that procedure if it's surgical. And I asked my oral surgeon, and he didn't even know about that, but that's like a great opportunity, right? just because there's so many things it's impossible to keep track. And I think the second and third things, there's all companies like Open Evidence helping with those. And I think really in the future with Assort we're going to really help with those points two and three of, you know, enabling physicians, right. You know, helping automate further parts of the patient care navigation journey and ensuring that, you know, we're delivering, you know, our whole mission is to make exceptional health care accessible anytime, anyplace for anyone. So that really exceptional part we want to do as well. And just doing a quick plug, we just raised, you know, a large sum of money, and we're hiring across the board. So please, you know, search up Assort health jobs. Please apply. I'll be around for a bit after this. Please find me. Especially if you're interested in AI for deployed type engineering. I think we have a great career track for you. That awesome plug. I think that was great, I guess. Yeah. So we're going to leave ten minutes at the end for for questions, but I guess I wanted to open up as well for the rest of the folks in the panel. I know everyone's kind of building businesses right now. And I'm curious, you know, if engineers were to join your team, the rest of you folks like what are some of the most complex challenges they're going to work on, as you think ahead to the next year or two in your businesses? So, like in the one of the thematic elements we've been talking about across the different speakers is people expecting that when they go to a website or they call their health care provider or interact with the business, that they get an answer instantly. And the bet that we're making is that it's going to be the same way with transfer of human knowledge. And so you're going to have a profile that you create, that you put in whatever content you have that exists on socials already. You have maybe podcasts or things you've written private notes to learn how you think and speak, and then your profile will be able to qualify and answer questions 24/7. And so you can see mine if you go to delphi.ai/sam It's my trained it on, on what I care about. In engineers that we're trying to hire company a little bit about me growing up. And it's good to speak about those things. So some of the things that we're working on and then we also just closed a 60 million series A from Sequoia earlier this year to build living profiles. And one of the things that we're working on that is going to become more important. And I'm sure in a year or two everyone will be talking about this is evals that are specific to a user. And so people are talking about evals. Evals are the moat maybe you've heard that LLMs so much of what you need to do with them is subjective and hard to quantify when it's successful. And so for us, it's even more difficult because the success criteria isn't just can you represent this, represent someone well? It's can you represent this person well? And so the success criteria is not only subjective, but it's subjective to the person. And so one of the things that we're doing is working on trying to create a system that creates evals that are good for each Delphi profile. And so this is a skill that's going to continue to be only more and more important as people try to get a grip on what it means to use AI systems and make them good, which you can imagine maybe OpenAI wants to know in a year. Like, is this ChatGPT user having a good ChatGPT session for them. Right now that you just exist for generally GPT 5 doing what they wanted to do. So that's one of the things Delphi's doing that's at the forefront. And then the conversations and the way you get answers. We just redid it to use an agent that has tools, and one of them is a knowledge graph, making a bet that that's going to be the architecture that people are going to want to build on over the next couple years. So if you're interested in doing either of those things, you can talk to my Delphi, talk to me afterwards, or send me and email at sam@delphi.ai And they had show maybe a little bit more rapid fire got like Awesome. So two technical challenges, one on the research side, one on the product side. So for research, we strongly believe that two things need to be done to actually make voice interfaces that people trust. The first is when people edit a mistake that happens in the output of any voice interaction. We should learn that, remember it for them to not repeat the mistake for them, and then use that to improve our models for everybody for people who choose to share AI. There's a fundamentally different approach to how to train voice recognition and speech recognition models. Nobody we know is doing right now. The second is on the product engineering side. So basically every voice assistant built today is not sticky. We want to go from voice dictation to voice interface. We know so many ways in which people want to use voice interfaces over and over and over again, and we're focused on building a lot of those. And then outside of engineering, I think everyone here can make use of the product. So go to wispeflow.ai and download it now. Okay. All right. Well, you know, even though I'm at a voice conference, really, we are working on AI pretty across the board. We're working on the physical AI and robotics side. We're working on reasoning models and scientific AI. And also voice is a really crucial part that we're, developing more and more as a user experience. So when we hire a mentor, we really think about what is like the full stack engineers we need in 2025. And we truly try to hire for people who are excited, build across the stack. So even our traditional full stack engineers, we're building, you know, the web dev, they're also building a lot on the AI side, even touching on a robotics side. On our robotics engineering side, they're also thinking about how what they're building on the physical AI side, then connects back to our AI reasoning models. And our user interface. So we're really hiring across the board, in engineering. But I think what the types of engineers are really looking for are the ones they're excited about, really hard problems that have huge impact. Right? Like if we're successful in building what we're building, we have the chance of eradicating disease in our lifetime with how fast AI is progressing in biology. And so if you're excited by that and want to solve, like really challenging problems in the physical world and also, really exciting problems in AI, you know, you can reach me at ml@medra.ai Michele Lee. So, yeah. Awesome. Thank you. I'm happy to hear that. Yeah, I'm hiring too. because I don't get to go, you know, Course we've got about ten minutes left here for for Q&A. So, if you have a question, stand up, talk loud. We don't have microphones. And I'll repeat the question and then we'll we'll give it to the panel. Just repeat the question. He's asking essentially went like, are we expecting a transition to happen from just voice to actually adding avatar and video on top of that? Yeah. So we actually put video in our product last year and people don't use it. Oh really? And part of the reason is because it's not there yet in terms of quality. And it's one of those products where similar to some of the things we've talked, we've talked about the Spotify and the Waymo, it's if it's not if it doesn't cross the uncanny valley, then people hate it. And so it exists. You can try it, but I think it will get better in the future. But voice is going to continue to be the dominant way that people prefer to interact, because you can do it on the go, and it also can be in tandem with other things you're looking at. Like a lot of the things we're talking about is how do I review what my robot's doing? Or how do I dictate what I want my software to do. All of those things are going to be more important. And even with the health care providers, I would be surprised if people end up in the future opting over where they're like, I want to talk to the avatar on video, or voice there's still kind of this sort of, plausible deniability where it's like, even though I know it's a robot. I really like the voice. Yeah, I totally agree. I think there's, you know, we have we work with pediatric groups. There's moms that are driving in from work, you know, like dropping off their kids. So I don't think video really adds any additional layer. And there's almost a layer of privacy that you get, which is voice. It can almost feel more intimate than, you know, talking to this video, avatar, even if it is really good, I still I don't think there's too much alpha to be gained there. Also, there's one very interesting thing that I read during COVID where I don't know if you've had the experience where if they sit on Zoom calls all day, they just feel really burnt out and they can explain why. And part of the reason is because you're not meant to have a face this close to you. Like, imagine when you are walking around and talking to people. How often are you talking to someone this close face to face? Almost never. And so it actually activates fight or flight because it’s like, Holy shit, there's someone in my face and so it's not really pleasant to be on Zoom calls for a long period of time. So I actually don't see it long term being a modality that people want to use over something like voice. . Yeah, there's definitely a lot of ways To summarize just for to hear the questions Essentially around, building compliance and in voice ai models. Yeah, yeah. Obviously in healthcare there's this extra hurdle because it all has to sit. So like, our evals have to sit in like PHI bunkers. Right. Because the evals, not the evals, but the, the, the the historical calls. Right. And like, so if you ever want to be able to see what went wrong, those things will have to live in like PHI bunkers. So, so that's like an extra step of, of difficulty here. But, in general, yeah. You have to be very careful with that stuff. I think, I've seen some startups that are like, very loosey goosey with that stuff. Not them, but other, but much, younger smaller ones, that have like, have, these real, loosey goosey attitudes. So I'd be a little wary of, like, the five person health care startup that's like doing voice agents. Just make sure they have all their, their like, you know, dotted I's and crossed T's there. Yeah, that's that's a great question. Adding on to what Nick said, you know, SOC 2 Type 2, these are things are a given. Right? It's extremely important. This is very sensitive information. We take that with a lot of, you know, we have security training for all of our employees, with all of our vendors. We have BAAA's in place. Right. So with like OpenAI or Gemini, they never like use our data. Right. They can never train on the data that we send them, to really comply with it. But making sure that all of that information is really secure, we self-host certain things. Our database is logically gated by so that, you know, information can never cross contaminate between different organizations. So I think it's, it's it's it's just a it's a lot more it's it makes things a lot more challenging, but it is like what we have to do. And I think, we look for people that are very interested in, you know, having those high security standards, very kind of, you know, you can't just it's not a social app. Nope. You know, there's there's a lot of things that you have to take into consideration. And read the VA's, because you can't just be like, oh, VA fine. Right. Like again, those, those companies are also new. And so some of those VA's are like shit. And, you got to make sure that, that, that these, subcomponents are also have, airtight VA's. All right, that's a question. So the question was most, most expensive mistakes made by these founders. We made a real expensive one. So we were a hardware company as our origin. We were a wearable brain computer interface company that would understand what you would say silently to yourself. And the R&D for all of that was going really well. We had a team of 35 or 40 building that, and we hooked it up to every voice interface that we had at that point. Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT and none of us wanted to use it. We didn't even want to use them with voice when we were in closed rooms, particularly frequently. And so that's when we started building software for the hardware. The first thing that stuck was flow, because voice dictation, something that you can use 100 times a day and it builds a really sticky habit. And so we had to pivot the entire company out of the hardware into the software. And so we had raised a good deal of money for a team of 40 neuroscientists and hardware engineers. And are a completely different business now. That's not a mistake. That's that's like that's like you figuring out what that's the that's all the startups. That's like, that's hardly a mistake. Like, you're saying you feel bad because absolutely like 100%. I mean, we went from 40 down to five and had to build back from there. Good. Like like this is like all this is like this. It's good for you for doing that. It is a win for everyone. Very expensive. And I, I like to tell you what we have this so I have this saying, I say at the end, at Zocdoc, which is, like JFK says, like we do these things, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. And I say the software engineering version of that is we do these things not because they're easy, but because we thought they'd be easy. And so, like, you're gonna you're gonna make mistakes and that's like, good for you for like, like having the guts to being like, we're gonna we're gonna, like, bring this back down to the bones and pivot it and figure out something that works. That's a success I would never call it. I'm gonna take that. I would say it was an expensive learning. That's how I think about it We all. And the more expensive the learning, the more I'll remember it. We each of us has a $100 million education, right? Like so like that's not I think that's just Silicon Valley and that's and that's One of the things that we did that was a big error early on was when we started the company we wanted to we start off by thinking that we're going to create the platform where we could have all of the profiles on it, and then people would come to it and use the profiles and ask questions and then get value from it. And we would make the profiles of the people, and we get so much attention that then we go to them and be like, look, there's so many people talking to your profile, don't you want to claim it? And so when we first started the company, we made one for Ed Newman and Esther Perel, Peter Attia and all these people were like, look, we're going to get a lot of people are going to like using it. And then within three weeks we got cease and dissists, like clockwork from all of them. Like, please don't do that. And they still won't work with us. So I think that was, expensive learning early on as well We got time for one more. If anyone else has. Maybe you can sneak in one last quick question. Yeah that's a great question. Especially I think for us we work with complex. You know there's all these rules like binders full of spreadsheets of rules. You've been in the doctor's office like all these things we have to follow and get right. And it's a very white glove onboarding service that we provide to get all these things right. And that's important. But it is a lot of, you know, a lot of hours and a lot of engineering time, a lot of implementation and Ops time. So that's a really interesting problem that we're working on called Project Sky Bridge is like, how do we automate a lot of the onboarding based on recordings from their VoIP, right? From their existing call center, right, electronic health record, electronic health record. Right. Even looking at like Medicare claims of the doctors to see what types of procedures and things that they perform so that it is an automated onboarding. And, it's still very white glove and getting things right, but it doesn't require nearly as much engineering work. So if you're an engineer and you're interested in that type of stuff, let me know. He's hiring What you're saying is very prescient, and correct, like it's going to get much easier, right? There's it's eventually to just be speech to speech. Right. Like, I mean, the neural nets just get better every year. And so it'll eventually just be speech and speech and it'll be simple. Think hard about like whether the company that you're creating has a moat. Like we have these rules, right? Like even even if that got super simple, we still have infinite like this Blue Cross problem that I said. So think about like the thing you're starting, is like, a layer this thick over over OpenAI. Right. But as OpenAI gets better, is your layer getting compressed? I had a guy, a product manager, come to me from a company that was critiquing, student essays in high school. That was their company. Like, right. Which is not a company anymore at all. Right? You're just like GPT, what's wrong with my essay? So, like, just make sure, that, you know, getting easy is better. Except if your company was doing the hard shit that got easy. So, it will get very easy. And make sure that the thing you're starting has a layer that stays hard even when the the neural nets, like, take over the world. And it's just to add on the I think it is really important if, companies are using a forward deployment engineering model that there is a platform that when the forward deployment engineers are building a lot of these these solutions that, you know, that helps them land the customer whatever they're building for a customer can go back into the main platform, because I think that, that was what, you know, Palantir was able to to build. Right? And I think without that being able to make it easy in the future, then you'll never be able to do that actual land and expand strategy across multiple customers. And that's definitely something that we think about a lot like our physical AI as a platform. But then as we do more and more protocols, like they all can then be shared across all our customers. But then our entry point for each customer is very different, right? Because one person might want to, grow sales, the other customer might want to do antibody engineering. But in the end, all of them are going to look very similar once you're inside the org. We're we're three minutes over here. So I was going to say whether Deepgram or Assembly was better, but... Unfortunately the I just wanna give a huge amount of thoughts for these founders and for you all today. Thank you so much. I think we have one more, fireside coming out. So hope you enjoy. Thank you, thank you."

    "text": "Tanay's Bio:\n\nTanay Kothari is the cofounder and CEO of Wispr, the company behind an AI-powered voice dictation app called Flow. Prior to starting Wispr in 2021, Tanay has been a serial entrepreneur for 16 years since he taught himself how to code as a child. He has founded multiple companies, many of them focused on the next generation of personal computing after Tanay was inspired by the character J.A.R.V.I.S. in the movie Iron Man. He has also held product and engineering roles at Cerebra Technologies and Microsoft and served as a Computer Science teaching assistant at Stanford University.\n\nTanay's Links:\n\nWebsite: https://wisprflow.ai/\nLinkedIn:   / tankots  \nX: https://x.com/tankots\n\nPhil’s Links:\n\nWebsite: https://www.philgcarter.com/\nSubstack: https://philgcarter.substack.com\nLinkedIn:   / philgcarter  \nX: https://x.com/philgcarter\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n1.  Tanay Kothari and Sahaj Garg cofounded Wispr in 2021 with the vision of using a native voice interface to power the next generation of personal computing. Since then, the company iterated through seven other products before ultimately finding strong product/market fit with an AI-powered voice dictation app called Flow.\n2.  The biggest thing Wispr Flow has done to differentiate its product vs. other voice dictation tools is tackle the upfront technical challenges that allow their product to work horizontally across any other single application. This year, Wispr Flow has been used successfully across over 25,000 different apps and websites.\n3.  Unlike other voice dictation tools that transcribe what a user speaks verbatim, Wispr Flow waits until a user has finished talking and then transcribes a polished version based on what the user would want if they were writing. It uses context awareness to understand what type of message the user is writing (email, text message, etc.) and then makes formatting decisions based on that context.\n4.  Two KPIs that Wispr Flow uses to measure product/market fit are zero edit rate and average time to send after completing a message. Wispr Flow’s zero edit rate is currently 81% and its average time to send is half a second, both of which are best-in-class vs. other voice dictation apps (including Apple and Google).\n5.  Wispr Flow has early adopters across a broad range of users, including founders and business leaders, engineers, creative influencers, and senior citizens. Its horizontal use case and simple and intuitive interface have also driven viral word of mouth, allowing the company to rapidly expand across international borders.\n\nEpisode Highlights:\n\n[00:00] Introduction\n[03:22] Why Tanay and his cofounder started Wispr\n[06:34] What differentiates Wispr Flow from other voice dictation tools\n[09:46] Wispr Flow’s contrarian design decisions\n[13:01] Technical challenges that Wispr Flow has needed to overcome\n[15:26] How Wispr Flow uses context awareness to tailor its outputs\n[17:50] Why Wispr Flow decided to launch across platforms sequentially\n[21:12] How Apple has inspired Wispr’s company culture\n[24:41] Who are Wispr Flow’s early adopters\n[27:44] KPIs Wispr Flow uses to measure product/market fit\n[30:17] The top apps that people are using Wispr Flow for\n[32:48] When Wispr Flow knew that it had product/market fit\n[37:15] How Wispr Flow generates virality through influencers\n[40:47] Wispr Flow’s long-term growth strategy and team structure\n[45:06] How Wispr Flow has approached international expansion\n[46:00] Lightning round\n\nPodcast Production by Podders: https://podders.io",

Welcome to Subversive, a podcast dedicated to sharing stories from the best consumer subscription apps in the world. We'll bring you lessons for how to grow your consumer subscription business, including insights and inflection points that led to exponential growth from leaders at category defining companies and innovative startups. Let's get into the show. My guest today is Tene Cathari, co-founder and CEO of Whisper, the company behind an AI powered voice dictation app called Flow. In this episode, I talked to TA about how Flow's zeroedit design philosophy differentiates it from other voice dictation tools, about the technical complexities that Whisper has needed to overcome to make Flow work across multiple platforms and more than 25,000 different applications, and about how the company's clever approach to influencer marketing has led to lots of free organic growth. All right, welcome today to the Subversive podcast. I'm really excited to have you on today to talk about Whisper and your first product, Flow. Uh this is an AI powered dictation app that I've personally been using a lot uh at my company and I'm hearing more and more people talk about it recently. So would love to hear a little bit more about you and the origin story behind this company and then we'll get into some of the early moves you've made to drive growth for the business. >> Of course. And by the way, thanks for having me here. This is I was I've been looking forward to this. So, we started working on Whisper Flow about a year ago. And for me, this has actually been a personal project I've been working on for the last 16 years, which is what is the next generation of personal computing feel like? Cuz back in 2008, when the first Iron Man movie came out, I wanted to build Jarvis. And so, me and a friend of mine built what was then one of the world's first voice assistants. This is before Siri, before Alexa. And to people, it just felt like magic. It grew to 2 and a half million users. Google then shut us down because they didn't like what we were doing. And over the years, I built about 60 70 different products in AI personalization, voice systems. And I think today the technology is finally ready to actually build something that feels like Jarvis, something that makes interacting with devices just as natural and effortless as talking to a close friend. And that is what we want to build with Whisper Flow. >> I love it. Well, and one of the things that is most inspiring about that story, one is that you were so young when you had this inspiration, but two is that you actually stuck with it. I I feel like there are a lot of 10, 12y olds running around being like, you know, I want to be an astronaut or I want to be an archaeologist. But you you saw the Iron Man movie and you very specifically said, I want to go build Jarvis. And then you've built not one, not two, but 60 or 70 different iterations of a product like it. So that brings us to Whisper today. Uh you said you've been working on it for around a year. Um tell me a little bit about the team, your co-founder and sort of the origin story around getting this product off the ground in the first place. >> Yeah, of course. So I started this company with Sahed, who is my co-founder and CTO. He and I actually go way back. We met first day of undergrad back at Stanford and then we ended up grooming together for the next three years. >> So I probably know this man better than most people really should. And uh with him, the thing he and I really aligned on was life is short, right? You live, you you're born, you live for a little bit, then you die. And so you want to spend your time doing >> the most impactful and meaningful work. And so for us it wasn't when we were talking the thing that we were excited about was going for the big swing and actually looking at not building a specific app but how people interface with technology >> cuz the thing that we cared about is making it more seamless. Like we are extremely annoyed by the fact that >> hey you walk around and you just see people stuck on their phones looking at screens all day long like this. And I wanted to step away from that. And so that was the starting point for us. And flow was actually the eighth product inside whisper that we built. The first seven had to do with taking actions. You could they were the the standard AI agent companies that you would see. And the challenge with those was the never build habit. >> And we then spent time just sitting beside people looking at them do work on their computer. And the non-obvious obvious insight hit us that what people spend a majority of their time doing on their computers and phones is typing. You type messages to friends, you type prompts to AI, you type emails to your customers and whoever else. And that is something that if you tap into, you start to have a massive impact on people's lives. The average person today types 5 hours every single day. And if you can half that, you give them back 20 to 30 full days of their life back, which is unreal actually. >> If you think about that and so that was the the inspiration to build flow and then pull the initial version. It started getting a lot of traction within the company. we all started using it for everything that we were doing and and that to us was the point where we decided to just focus the entire company onto that and uh make it something that just an average person on the street could start using. >> So I love that you called it a nonobvious obvious insight. It's one of these things that we all do so often and we spend so much of our times doing it. just typing emails, typing out memos, reports, presentations that you sort of take it for granted at some point. >> Um, and so sometimes these big insights can just be hiding in plain sight. Um, so you've built this AI powered voice dictation tool, but it's certainly not the first voice dictation tool that's existed. There are many other versions of a product like this that have existed for years. So what is it in particular that Whisper Flow does today that is already differentiated from the other dictation tools out there and then where do you see it evolving in the coming years? It's it's really simple how we differentiate ourselves in this specific domain because every single other dictation platform, right? There's the Google, Apple, OpenAI, everybody else in the world, they try to put down every single word that you're saying word for word. They pride themselves on that. All the metrics, everything else is on it, which is fantastic actually for video transcriptions. It's fantastic >> if uh you want to record something, but if you're talking about putting our thoughts down as people, as messages or whatever, you speak differently than you write. And that's the key insight we went after. And so what whisper does is it hears you when you speak naturally, your rambles and all, and then it writes just how you would have written. >> H >> what that means is if you say, \"Hey, let's meet at 5. actually know let's do six. It's going to write, \"Hey, let's meet at 6 because that's what you wanted it to write.\" So, imagine how a smart person sitting on your computer would have written what you're telling them to write. That's how I have the mental model of what flow should be doing for you. And there are so many small nuances that that come. Uh when you're saying a long rambly list of things, it puts it into bullets. When you're writing an email, it formats it like an email. when you're sending a text message, it's lowercase, it's got emojis, it's got all of that. And so, the biggest thing that we care about is how do you output something that people just look at? They're like, \"This is perfect.\" And they just press send. And the most magical thing about it that we measure is how long does it take for people after they see what Flo wrote to press enter? >> Yeah. >> A second. Nobody even reads what Flow writes anymore after they've used it for a few days because they just trust Flow to just get them. >> Wow. I love that. I I mean, it's so compelling when a company has built something so novel and interesting that they identify a metric that is very bespoke to their business >> that represents sort of that magic of the experience. I think one of the canonical examples is Facebook's X number of friends in Y days as the activation moment when if you cross that threshold then you you Facebook has a lot of confidence that you're going to be a highly retained user. And so for you it makes a lot of sense that it used to be voice dictation tools were just so clunky that they were borderline non-usable. I think for a long time now that technology has been good enough to get an output that is identical to what you said, but what you said isn't necessarily what you want in a written communication. And so these autoedits that you've built into flow just lead to a more compelling output. It's not what the user said, it's what they want. And that's actually two different things. Um, so let's talk a little bit more about some of the early design decisions that you all made that were were different from some of your predecessors. >> Um, what are some of the other specific features that you've built into Flow's user experience that that make it look and feel different? >> The first one I'd say is most other apps need you to go inside their application to voice dictate something. Then you have to copy paste it back into where you want. That's extra steps. Our whole company is built upon removing those extra steps. >> So we did the harder upfront work of making it something that runs in the background and works in literally any single application. You just hold on a button, speak, let go. You don't have to think about any integrations. You don't have to switch tabs. You don't have to do anything at all. And that from an engineering side is insanely hard to build. But that to us was a non-negotiable from when we were starting because the other thing you get when you build something that's seamless is it's just not a product that is stuck within Silicon Valley. There are people who are the least tech friendly tech forward people who can just start using flow cuz it's trivial to use. The other big major design decision we made was most of the dictation systems show you the text as it's streaming in word for word. We actually decided to not do that for two reasons. The first one is it is actually distracting >> to read what you said half a second ago and there is very little value to that. And so what we do is instead we show you everything that you said at the end of it. And so you speak for a while and then Flo just said cool here you go here's what you said. The other thing you get from it is I don't know if you've ever sat in a in a Tesla and you know how it would track the path of where the car is going and it would just like vibrate like nobody's business and you'd be like I don't know if this car knows what it's doing. >> Yeah. >> When these voice dictation systems like are streaming text in real time, they often go and edit things afterwards. Uh you've probably probably seen this with all of them. that actually loses user trust >> because they're like it doesn't seem like you you've got like your handle on this really >> and if instead you're like I'm going to give you the perfect thing at the end and I'm not going to really tell you like all the hard work that goes into coming with this changes the user mindset generates a lot more trust and those were two design decisions that were very different than what any other system had done so far. >> Yeah. Well, and it seems very complimentary because you said earlier that these auto edits and the sort of zeroedit send within 0.5 seconds after completing the message is is the number one thing that differentiates flow from all of its predecessors. And it's very complimentary with the design decision to not show how the sausage gets made. Right? We're not going to show you everything you're saying as you're saying it. We're just going to save that to the end. And that also gives us the additional degrees of freedom to be able to make modifications before we present the final output. So the whole is almost greater than the sum of its parts because these features play nicely together. to the extent that you can share. I know you don't want to go deep into the technology, but you you talked about how number one seamlessly integrating this experience across all of the different contexts, the different applications, the different use cases that a knowledge worker or other early adopter of your product would want to use is technically complex. to the extent you can share like what what what are some of the challenges that you have faced and how have you gone about overcoming some of those challenges? >> Here's one uh if you try to create a bulleted list in notion versus Slack versus Gmail versus Outlook versus a Notepad text editor that doesn't support bulleted lists. It all looks and is different under the hood. M >> oh so we needed to have some way where it would just work where in every single application and for reference in this year people have used whisperflow in over 25,000 apps and websites. >> Wow. >> With zero that it did not work in. >> And so that's like one kind of complexity. The other one is, this is actually really annoying when you paste things into Outlook or or Gmail. >> I was hoping I was hoping you were going to bring up this example because it is so frustrating. >> Oh my god, it's so bad. And then that was another thing that we had to fix and and then get to work in those systems. And it's all these small details, right, that that add up, but once you start knocking out each of them, and this is such a system that works. whenever any of our users had tried out another product, they just immediately come back to flow a day later. And it was like some small frustration that the other product didn't solve cuz it's it's hard. You need lots of attention to detail. And I think that that's one of the uh the unique things that I do pride our team on is they're insanely just maniacal about getting everything perfect and right and every small detail just gets surfaced up. Well, it's one of the nice things about having a product that while it's extraordinarily technically complex under the hood, yeah, >> it's actually relatively simple in terms of the amount of product surface area you're showing to the end consumer. And that allows you the focus to be maniacal about getting every last detail right. >> Yes. One other implication of what you said I think but keep me honest here is because you've had to do all of this engineering around understanding the context that a user is in >> down to in many cases sounds like the specific app that also means you can infer what sort of message they're trying to send an email type out a presentation write a memo a Slack message and you talked earlier about how the tone and the specific words that somebody is trying to say >> often look different across those different contexts. And so am I understanding correctly that when you use flow to dictate a message into email versus Slack versus notion, your project is actually making different decisions on the margins about how to take the exact words it heard and then format it into a final output that is well suited to that application. >> Exactly. It it does just that. And this is a segue into the next thing that we're going to be adding soon, which is the the insight that we had is yes, even though your emails may sound different than your Slack messages, even within that there's nuances. You might talk differently in a public thread versus in a single DM with your best friend who works at the same company. And so that's the next thing that we're going to be shipping where it understands the context of every single thread that you're in >> and then understands your tone there and tries to match that >> which is the next magic that we're going to be shipping soon. >> I love that. Well, and I I spent a few years early in my career in venture capital as an associate. And one of the things I would look for is, you know, a founder whose vision goes like multiple levels deep on the level of detail and specificity that you're paying attention to to solve problems at the level of nuance that, you know, a lay person just wouldn't even think of. >> And to to me, this is such a great example of that. Like as a consumer writing an email or writing a message in Slack or using voice dictation tool to do that, you would never think about all of the nuance under the hood of why these messages are different and how the applications are coded differently and what that means in terms of formatting bullet points. But you're all the way down to that level and that's to me that's what leads to um truly exceptional uh product design. I guess another question is how did you decide to launch across platforms sequentially and what sort of lessons did you learn as you went from one platform to the next to the next to the point where you are now where it now works seamlessly across platforms. >> We started off essentially balancing out the technical effort that it would take with where are the markets that are easiest for us to tap into. So for the first one, we knew that we have an incredible audience in Silicon Valley, New York, LA, some of the leading metro cities in the world. And Macs are most popular there. So we decided to start off with Mac on desktop. It was also the platform that had the most support for us to be able to grab context, build a really delightful experience. And so we decided to launch for for Mac first. And when we launched for that, it became very clear that that is a lot of work that goes into building this system work well on any platform because whisperflow works at an operating system level. And so it's gathering a lot of context there. And so once we had built it for that, we understood what we needed to do with that. And then we pushed it over to Windows. Now you'd imagine like desktop desktop same thing except it it wasn't. And so that again took a few months of work. And for us, we never want to ship a half-ass product. Our bar for shipping something is we actually have about 10 times the number of features inside the company that you as an external person would see. >> Mhm. >> And every single one of them goes through the ringer until it heads product market fit internally until half the company's like, \"Holy I cannot live without this thing. This thing is magical.\" >> Mhm. >> Then and only then do we ship it externally. And so to pass that high bar takes time. And so we're like, okay, then we're going to prioritize Windows, which we did. And after that, my my initial assumption was, okay, we hit product market fit with dictation on desktop. Uh, dictation on mobile, same thing. Biggest, no, no, not biggest mistake, but rookie mistake, right? Because it wasn't completely different surface, completely different platform. The only thing common was you speak and it writes things for you. And so very soon within a month of using the mobile app, it was clear that we need to go from 0 to one on product market fit on this thing again. And that honestly took 6 months. It took a lot of hard work. The mobile app was launched about 3 weeks ago. And right now it's on build 152. >> Wow. >> It has gone through 150 revisions to get to this point where we were proud to ship it to an external user base. And um I think right now they did a phenomenal job of it. But that was the essentially like core of it. And now that we're building for Android, again building for Android and iOS, you cannot assume the same thing cuz Android is fundamentally different on the operating system level. And so we're essentially going to have to do a lot of these things from scratch again. And Android, I think, is going to be one of the best experiences we would have shipped uh given some of the things that we're seeing uh internally and and I cannot wait to have that go out. >> Yeah, that's exciting. One thing that doesn't get talked a lot about is I guess what I'll call product culture fit, right? On one end of the spectrum, you have Facebook move at least in the early days of Facebook where they were a social network and it was all just about rapid experimentation and keeping up with uh the rapid early adoption of users on college campuses to on the other end of the spectrum you've got Apple as a good example where you know Steve Jobs's bar was famously high and in a context where you're building hardware tools and specifically trying to build some of the best hardware products in the world you know that makes sense. So where on that spectrum do you think Whisper falls as a company and Flow falls as a product? And to what extent do you think Whisper's early culture is a function of you and your co-founders personalities versus a deliberate decision you made because of the products you're building and the customers you're serving. >> I think we're pretty close to the Steve Jobs bar on things. And that is because of how fundamental the product that we're building is to people's lives. Imagine if every 100 times your keyboard stopped working. You would throw that keyboard out the window. >> Yep. >> If every hundred friend requests you send on Facebook, one of them didn't go through, you wouldn't even notice. >> Right. And it's so so fundamental about the kind of product you're building and how it fits into people's lives and the bar of reliability that you need. And so that is one of the reasons why we have been so focused and reliability is one part of it. The other part of it is just like taste and product design how intuitive things feel because the product is all about building building habits. And so I think those two things make it uniquely uh very focused on uh a lot of detail and iteration and and polish that needs to happen. funnily enough that is not my personal way in which I build things as um somebody who is my my mental model is a lot towards growth right like historically for all the products that I've built it's like cool here's an MVP after 24 hours of like pulling an allnighter let's ship it let's see how people are reacting let's go and update it afterwards and build that but this was one of the things that I personally had to adapt uh because it needed me to adapt and there are some things that we'll do where we're going to be moving at that pace. >> Uh but the hard thing was how do you manage that insanely fast pace of building with also that product quality and so the the answer to that question is you just do a lot of those reps internally. >> Yeah, I love that. And I feel like a lot of the best founders do adapt their culture and their approach to the product they're building and the customer they're building it for. But uh it's it's also very easy to just get set in your ways and fall back on your own tendencies. And so um that's great to hear that this was a deliberate choice and it sounds like it's um very compatible with the company you're trying to build. So now let's >> also my co-founder Sahes like he is he is very much more on the spectrum of like focus like just do things right and so he's been an incredible balancing force to me as well. And so >> I I add in the hustle and move fast. He adds the polish culture and together it's polish with speed that we end up delivering as a company. >> Sounds like a good a good yin-yang team. >> Our relationship genuinely is. >> Well, we we've talked about product culture fit. Let's talk about product market fit. And let's start with who have your early adopters been? Like is there a particular segment of customers that you find you're resonating most with and and why? >> Our user group has been surprisingly very very varied. And so a few kinds of people who love this product is a lot of founders and business leaders. For them, Jared's job is primarily communication first and that's how they get leverage. That's how they make the biggest decisions and manage large groups of people across their customers, teams, whatnot. Apart from that, the other groups we've really seen really strong product market fit are people who are very thoughtful. They have a lot of thoughts. They want to put those down. They want to think through it. That's how they kind of reason through things. And finally, it's a lot of developers and engineers who today are using AI and prompting for a lot of work that they're doing. And for them actually the the insightful thing is when they are speaking in English and they're writing code with their fingers, there's actually no context switching happening versus if they're prompting and writing code and constantly switching between the two of them before. >> And so that actually lets them stay in the flow. And so we saw these people come in as early adopters, just had incredible um organic word of mouth growth through them. And the other group of people which is actually about 30% of our user base is what I would call nontechnical users. >> Mhm. These are people who have maybe used chat GPT, right? And the way we got these people is uh people like you or me would find this tool and just be like, \"Wait, this is great cuz I have like my my dad or my grandfather has like this issue, arthritis, can't type, very slow at typing, like hunt and peck, you're doing this, and if this is there for them, like this would be incredible.\" >> So, it's all of these people who are onboarding their parents. And so we actually had to like spend a lot of time with with old people, we call them silvers, >> uh to to sit with them and figure out what parts of it are not intuitive, how can we make this even more intuitive for you? Cuz if that is the lowest common denominator we're building for, I think the product becomes intuitive for the average human being. >> Yeah. Yeah. That's so interesting. So it sounds like you started with what I would have expected to hear, which is you have a lot of these business leaders, tech co-founders, Silicon Valley insiders using the product. You also got a lot of engineers and software developers using the product. >> But then what's been surprising is it is such a horizontal use case, right? We all spend lots of time typing on our desktops and our mobile devices. And so you've been pleasantly surprised to find that a lot of counterintuitive use cases have emerged. One of them being um senior citizens or people who are getting a little bit older and so their typing is slowing down or they have a physical disability that makes typing difficult and this this has been a real godsend for them. You talked earlier about this metric you have which is >> half a second between finalizing a message and sending it which which is so fascinating. Are there any other particular metrics or key performance indicators you've been using to track your progress towards product market fit and then strengthening that product market fit over time? >> The biggest one we've noticed is this metric we built inhouse which is called zero edit rate which is what percentage of messages are perfect and ready to send. And if you compare Apple, Google a lot of the other basic dictation platforms that at about 10 to 15%. Mhm. >> So only 10 to 15% of the time is what you have said and what they produce is you just press send on. The rest of the time you have to edit it. >> For whisper flow that today is at 81%. >> Four-fifths of everything that Whisperflow produces people just press send on. Very rarely do they need to edit it. >> Yeah. >> And when they're usually editing, we found that it's because they changed their mind afterwards or they're like, \"Ah, this is not exactly what I wanted to say.\" And so the the thing that is what we found is the closer or the higher we get that metric even a 1 percentage point improvement on that massive impact and how happy users are with it. And this is something that has been growing as we've been improving the the technology learning more from how people are using the system. And so I think it's gone from about 40% from when we started the early prototypes to 80% now. And it just keeps increasing as we keep improving the product. And this is interesting because this goes to one of our core goals of making a voice interface people trust >> and you will trust us if you don't have to go and correct everything it does and you're just mostly like okay FL's got this I I'll let it do its thing. >> Yep. So it's both the edit rate which if I heard you correctly 80% of voice memos that get dictated into flow do not get edited. So four out of five are edit free. And then the amount of time that it takes between when a user completes the message and when they send it. And that is averaging half a second now, which basically means they're not editing it at all. >> Editing, they're not even reading it is the bigger point. >> They don't even need to look at the content. They've used it enough and they trust it enough that they'll just hit send without without even giving it a second review. Uh, which >> yeah, I mean, if if you need an indicator of of strong product market fit, that's that's about as good as you're going to get. We talked about who your early customers have been. I'm also curious, you talked about there are these 25,000 different applications that Flow has been used on so far, but I imagine there's a very steep power curve. And so what are the top, call it 5 to 10 applications that people are using Flow with? And I'm particularly interested in the degree to which people are using flow to dictate into LLMs like Chat GBT and Claude because I find that there's such a complimentary relationship between what you've built in those tools because the tools are smart enough that they can take an even an imperfect output and they can they can create something really powerful out of it and then you can iterate back and forth. And so that's one of the number one things I've been using flow for. I'm curious if you're seeing that with your customers as well. Yeah, the power law is actually not as strong as I would have expected. So the top 20 apps actually just account for a third of the usage. >> Okay. >> And some of the top ones that we've seen used, you'll get your usual suspects which is like claude, chat, GPT, perplexity that people use flow in. The very interesting thing I found about that was those all products have their own mic buttons. They have their own voice input. >> Mhm. But what we found is people still love using Flow for it. >> Yeah. >> Faster, more accurate. And more than anything, people have the habit now of using Flow wherever they are. And so you just wouldn't go press that button there cuz you're just like, I know Flow. I know it's going to work. I have my habit of doing this. I'm just going to keep doing that. We see people use that in these LLMs a lot. The other place where we see people use it a lot is actually emails, >> which to us is a is a big compliment to the product because people today send emails for their professional communications, especially ones that are going out to customers, people external to the company who you want to have a really good impression in front of. And what flow essentially does is it just formats your messages so coherently, so easy for the other person to read that people trust it for those external messages. And then finally, the the category that we see um people use it a lot for as well is in coding. So cursor is I think one of the biggest platforms that we have and there are a couple of users who've genuinely dictated one and a half million words into cursor in the last 6 months. >> I don't even know what they're building but it it's wild. >> That is wild. >> Yeah. >> Um all right, last related question around product market fit is just was there a particular product launch or moment you can point to when you really knew you had product market fit? I feel like product market is one of those things where it's sort of like you know it when you see it. So what was that moment? >> I I'd always heard about that. You'll know it when you see it. But then we felt that and it was like okay yeah this we know exactly what people meant by this. That started happening in January of this year. It wasn't a launch. There's nothing else. Apart from the fact that every day there were 5 to 10 people who unprompted would post about how much they loved flow on LinkedIn on Twitter. For most of these people, if you go and look at their posts, they have never posted about a product in their life. >> And suddenly, this was this one company that came up and they were like, \"This has completely changed how I live my life.\" And then other people in the thread was like, \"Okay, I just tried it out and this is incredible. Thank you so much for finding it.\" And you just saw that happen purely organically. And I think at that point when people describe the product as this has changed my life, you don't even need to ask them the question like would you be disappointed if this goes away cuz >> sure more than disappointed if this goes away. >> Yeah. >> Um and the second thing that happened around then was was January was the time when we started really seeing uh exponential growth happen within the company and that's when a lot of systems started breaking. >> Mhm. Every time flow would be slower for an hour, our support inbox would be filled to the brim. Initially, I was like, \"Oh god, so much to respond to.\" But then my reaction was like, \"Wait a second. If this goes out for a little bit, these are the number of people who care enough about the product and where it matters to them that they have taken out the time to send us a message like asking about how to fix it. Some of them are very frustrated and then we fix it and they're like, \"I love you guys.\" Like that that happens all the time. But it's like, \"Wow, this is making people feel things and people that's way better than just them being ambivalent to what you're doing.\" >> Yeah. You know, it's funny that anecdote reminds me of an experience I had when I was in Mature Capital. I mentioned that earlier. And this was between 2013 and 2015. And so it was right around the time that a lot of VC firms were starting to try to apply more and more quantitative analysis to sort of pattern matching what early indicators leading indicators of rising star you know seed series A series B companies would look like. Obviously once you get to a certain stage you have tons of data but in in the early days when a company's just getting escape velocity it can be hard to recognize from the outside. And one of the insights I I stumbled upon was that specifically within the social networking category, if you looked at um the number of ratings and reviews that a social network got and then you looked at the average rating out of five stars, you wanted a very large volume of ratings and reviews. That's sort of obvious, right? If you don't have a certain amount of volume, it means not enough people are interested in the product to be rating it. But counterintuitively, some of the most successful, fastest growing social networking startups actually had middling ratings. So what so what you were looking for was the combination of a very large and rapidly growing number of ratings and reviews, but actually somewhere more in the like 3.5 to four star range, not necessarily 4.5 to five star. Because what that meant was you were pulling in enough people fast enough who had strong enough opinions that they cared about this product. and and where it was going. And if everybody was happy with it, that probably meant it wasn't being bold and ambitious enough with its vision or it wasn't different enough from what already existed. >> And so what I hear you saying is something similar and that's that >> as the founder and CEO of this company, you're sort of this is your baby and it hurts to hear people write in and say that they're frustrated, but at the same time it's sort of a backhanded compliment because for somebody to take time out of their busy day to write you that email, they must have cared enough to want you to fix it. Yeah. Um, and so I think that's that's a good reminder to all of the founders out there who are putting in late hours trying to get their company uh to the point where um people care enough to be frustrated. >> Um, all right, let's move into our last section here, which is around growth strategy and how you've gotten early adoption. Subversive at the end of the day is ultimately a podcast about growth. So much of your early growth has been organic. How have you managed to generate so much viral word of mouth among adopters outside of the obvious which is just building a world-class product? Is there anything else you've done to really get people to be talking about this online or offline? >> There are a couple of very intentional things that we learned and that has driven both of what we do and what we don't do. The thing we realized very interesting about the space we're in is if I show up to somebody and I was like, \"Hey, I'm building a voice dictation tool. You should try it.\" No one's going to try it >> because they're like, \"Yeah, so did the last hundred people who said that and I know what they delivered.\" >> Yeah, >> there's a lot of distrust here. But if you went and you told somebody, \"Hey, I'm trying this voice dictation tool and it's insane.\" No one has ever said that before about any voice dictation tool. So that is that is what generates trust. >> And so that is the thing that we realized very early on that this is what is going to sell this product. It's not me. It's not Whisper saying things about itself. It's other people talking about the value prop. >> And so what we did was early on um we reached out to a lot of influencers, lots of people who make content. And for me, it wasn't even like sponsorship. It was like, \"Hey, here's a tool. I think you might like it. Use it for free.\" >> Y >> some people did. And the great thing about those influencers make using it is it just showed up in every single one of their videos. >> As a few of these creators, you go on their website, every single video they're just using flow. They're talking about whatever else. There's other companies who are sponsoring and paying for it. But Whisper Flow is the star of the show for the next two and a half hours. And every third comment is, \"What are you using for voice text? What are you using for voice to text?\" Most of these people, not affiliates, not sponsors, no nothing. And like they just reply like whisper flow, whisper flow, whisper flow, whisper flow. >> Yeah. >> And that has been huge because what we what we found is like yeah, these people just want to learn from the best and copy whatever they're doing. >> Yeah. >> Uh so that worked really well and also focused our team and that's why our growth team is so small. Like we don't produce a lot of content by ourselves. It's not going to do well. we have other people produce all that content for us uh for essentially giving them a free euro flow. >> Yep. I mean it's one of the advantages of being such a horizontal use case. There are certainly plenty of challenges and I had Rachel Hepworth on from from Notion to talk about notion's growth story. >> You talked about the challenge of being a product that has so many different use cases that people don't where know where to begin. But one of the advantages is if you can get past if you if you can get enough activation energy to get past a tipping point, then it can be used in all of these different contexts. And I would have never thought of of that idea, but it makes so much sense that rather than pay an influencer to go do a sponsored UGC video for your product, just give them the product for free, let them play with it, and then if it's compelling enough, they'll start using it all their other videos, and you sort of become a free rider on all of the UGC content they're doing with all these other companies. So that's that's amazing. What what a great strategy. >> Sometimes there's one or two people who then message me and ask me to do a podcast with them. There you go. There you go. Free marketing for Flow right here. >> Yeah. Um, >> I didn't even give it to you for free. >> That's true. That's true. Although, I do think I have a free membership now, but I did have to pay for that first month. So, maybe I should ask for a refund. That's a good point. You You'll be getting a customer support ticket from me later this afternoon. >> Um, how are you thinking about your medium to long-term growth strategy? Like, you you at this point, you've got product market fit. You're starting to see this exponential growth. the momentum is building, but but where do you think your growth will come from over the next two to three years? And then I'm always curious to ask, >> how are you structuring your go to market team to support that strategy? >> That is a phenomenal question. That's actually one of the key things that I've been thinking about a lot uh recently and there are there's two motions that I've broken it into. The first one is acquiring a lot of individual users and grabbing a lot of mind share. >> Mhm. And then there are a lot of kind of growth tactics to go and do that and very intentionally within the company every growth initiative is broken down into is this for awareness or is this for conversion. >> Yeah. >> Right. Because then that doesn't confuse those two things and just keeps the goals very clear. Um and the second part of it is okay we have an individual user on board and the unique thing about flow is it has really easy distribution within companies. So, how do we take that individual person and then upsell them into getting their entire company onto FL? And we did that recently with companies like Superhum and Substack and Mercury >> and a lot of law firms, a lot of other financial institutions and hundreds of other companies which has been been doing well. And so when I think about our growth motion, it's it's interesting. It's a combination of this B2C and B2B that we're running together. Culture- wise, I think the biggest thing that we wanted to set up from a B2C perspective is the is a norm of experiments and a norm of doing things fast. So, if if you're on my growth team, Phil and you come up with an idea like I think we should do this thing. >> Mhm. >> And it doesn't sound ridiculous, I want that to be done and shipped anywhere from between the next 1 to 5 days. >> Yep. I don't want to have any extended like back and forth of does this make sense? Can we do this any better? It's like no, ship it. Let's try it. We learn if we want to make it better. And the more we could do to support that velocity within the organization and make people very independent to be able to do that, I think the faster we move overall. And that's that's hard to have that mindset cuz sometimes people are afraid of making mistakes. Sometimes people are perfectionists and you want to get things done well like myself included. >> Yeah. >> And that has been one of the things that we're we're kind of like pushing forward as the mindset for every single person in the company to have is just ship it. And and this is interesting, right? Because you'll notice in the first part of the conversation I was talking about how we're very intentional and thoughtful about building products and everything >> and in growth it's different. And so what we essentially have to balance is the growth mindset of like the the shipping fast and encapsulated to a certain set of projects and the deeply thoughtful lots of iterations, perfection inside the product and have these two cultures exist side by side within the same company. >> Yeah, I'm so glad you brought that up because I was going to go back to that as well. It sounds like on core product you have a very high Steve Jobsian bar of what makes it out into the world, but on growth product it's the complete opposite. It's move fast and break things. It's let's throw stuff against the wall and see what sticks. And it reminds me so much of my time at Quizlet where >> um I came in as uh the first growth product leader. uh we had one product manager at the time working on growth and we expanded um the growth product team um into a much larger group of PMs, designers, engineers, but we had to very much instill this culture of the way you approach a problem as a growth PM or a growth engineer looks very different than how you would approach it on core product because a significant percentage of the experiments we run are going to be failures and then we're going to learn from our mistakes and move on. And the last thing we want to do is goldplate the code for >> an AB test that may not go anywhere. So, it is a different mindset. >> Um, last question before we get to our lightning round. So, you've already seen global adoption. More than 50% of your users are outside of the US. What's been your secret to expanding internationally so quickly or is it all just happened because people love the product and they're just talking about it across borders? >> Huge part of it is organically. The second part was unlike most other companies the first version of whisper flow that we launched worked across a 100 languages >> and so from day one we built it for international audience. Uh part of it also came because in our team of 16 people we speak a total of 30 languages >> which is 30 different languages which is wild and so >> the the team is very international and so that that culture just seeped into the product. It's it certainly helps when you're solving for your own need. And so if you have >> if you have the luxury of having a a early team that speaks that many different languages, then I could see how that would make things easier. >> Well, let's get to our lightning round. I want to ask you a series of rapidfire questions and you can just give me short responses. The first one I always like to ask is just what do you think is the best part about working at Whisper and what's one thing that you would change? >> I wish our team was in person. Our team is 30% remote and whenever they come into the office it is the most fun week and I just I just wish uh and and most people can't can't move because family reasons but I I wish they could. >> Yeah, that's something I hear from founders in particular and to me it's so emblematic of you have a lot of individual contributors who will say the opposite. It's such a relief to work remotely and it's so much easier to balance work and family, especially if you have kids. But as a founder or as a founding team, you know, this is this is one of your families, right? You're the company you're building is >> it very much feels like your work family. And I can totally relate to that. Like being together with your colleagues in the office, there's there's no feeling quite like it. And so, while there are many wonderful aspects of remote work, I can I can certainly understand where you're coming from. Um, what is the coolest AI app you're using right now that most people haven't heard of? >> I would say Sunno. >> I use it to make music and it is maybe the most underrated AI product of all time cuz I think video generation is just about getting to a point where it starts to feel real. Image generation questionable how good you think it is. But Sunno is incredible. >> So good. >> I'm going to have to try it. I've heard SUNO come up a couple times actually on this podcast because there are a lot of creative teams that are using Sono to apply music tracks to uh video ads, but I haven't used it myself. So, I'm going to have to go to try. >> It's great for that, but the songs I make, I listen to more than Spotify now. >> Oh, wow. >> I did not expect that to happen. >> Very cool. I'll have to give it a try. >> Um, if you could add one premium feature to Flow tomorrow, what would it be? >> I have so many. I have so many. Uh the biggest one would be for it to be able to do things for you and take actions on your behalf. >> So we've come full circle back to the agentic vision you had when you first founded Whisper because you said the first seven products that Whisper built were sort of agentic actionoriented products. flow is this voice dictation tool, but now you want to build on the foundation you've already built with voice dictation to be >> exactly because now you have the habit and now you can stack on a lot of things. Starting off with that would have been a mistake. >> Yeah, makes sense. Um, what do you think is the toughest user experience challenge for voice first apps over the next two to three years? I think we're going to see more and more of these products that are using voice as sort of the native interface of the product. But what do you think the UX challenges look like there? The biggest one that I'm starting to see happen, this is especially on Apple, is all of the privacy limitations and popups and restrictions that they are starting to put in. And that I think harms the user experience the most. That's one thing that I wish they would change. >> Yeah. Well, you certainly aren't the first to complain about Apple and their approach to privacy restriction. Last one. If you could go back, you mentioned that you started to code, I believe, when you were around 12 years old. So, if you could go back, what would you say to your 12-year-old self who was just learning to code for the first time about building technology products? >> Honestly, I think you did a fine job. If I if I changed anything about that, I wouldn't be where I am and I wouldn't be the person I am today. through all the struggles and all that I had to go through myself. All the apps that barely had any users that led to all the apps that had millions and I think that learning is a part of the process. So I would just I would just tell him to keep doing what he thought was the right thing to do and he'll figure it out. >> I love that. I mean it goes back to the growth mindset you talked about at the beginning of the episode and it's one thing to say you have a growth mindset but it's another thing to actually live it. And it sounds like uh you've been very authentic to that even even from the time you were you were just getting started as a young kid. Well, thank you so much tonight for coming on. This has been a really enjoyable discussion and I I've certainly learned more about about the product than I even knew even though I've been a user for a while now. Any parting words you want to give the audience before we wrap up here? >> I the biggest thing I'd say is we just raised a $30 million series A and now on track to grow faster and faster exponentially. And if you're somebody who's excited about growth, excited about building incredible products, especially ones that put smiles on people's faces day in day out, then drop me a note and I'd love to chat more. >> Well, you certainly have my vote of confidence. It's a great product and as a growth professional myself, I think it's a great company to be building your career. So, thanks again, TA. This has been a pleasure and um I I really appreciate your time today. >> Phil, this is fantastic. Thanks for having me."

        "srt": "You know that feeling when your brain is absolutely racing, just grimming with brilliant ideas, but uh your fingers just can't quite keep up on the keyboard. Oh, definitely. Or trying to send a quick message and your thumbs feel like lead. Exactly. It's that constant kind of friction point in our digital lives, isn't it? It really is. Well, today on the deep dive, we're plunging headirst into that exact problem. We're exploring how cutting edge AI is fundamentally transforming the way we interact with our devices. specifically well through the power of our voice. That's right. And our mission today is uh to unpack a recent TechCrunch article. It really zeros in on this pivotal moment in AI and human computer interaction. Okay. We're going to pull out those essential nuggets of knowledge, you know. Mhm. From this piece about a company called Whisper Flow. Whisper Flow. And show you not just what's happening in AI, voice tech, the incredible leaps, but crucially why it matters to how you get things done every single day. Yeah. How it affects us. We're talking about a pretty significant maybe even revolutionary leap in how we'll communicate with computers. Okay. So, diving right in then. One thing that uh immediately stands out from our source material is just how much attention AI voice technology is getting right now. Startups developing these kinds of applications are truly well having their moment. This isn't some niche thing anymore. No, not at all. There's serious investor attention pouring into this space. It really feels like a real inflection point. What's particularly striking, I think, is how widespread this investment is. It's across the whole AI ecosystem. Really, it's not just one type of company. We've seen the model builders, you know, the folks creating the core AI algorithms like 11 Labs and Cartisia. Yeah. The foundational tech. Exactly. They've raised millions Yeah. millions of dollars in just the last few months. But the funding doesn't stop there. It's also hitting the application layer hard. The actual tools you and I might use. Like what? Well, think about AI powered notetakers like granola or uh meeting tools like read AI and Fireflies AI. Yeah. Those summary tools. Yeah. All of those have pulled in significant investor backing. Yeah. And that well that signifies a massive belief in the future of these AIdriven interfaces. It's the whole ecosystem from the ground up getting this boost. And speaking of that powerful trend, our main focus for today's deep dive is, as you said, Whisper Flow. They just announced a really substantial $30 million in series A funding. 30 million? Wow. Yeah. Which brings their total raise now to a uh whopping $56 million. That's serious capital. It is. And the lead investor on this round, Menllo Ventures, which, you know, immediately tells you they've got some heavy hitters believing in them. Definitely a top tier firm. And they're not alone. NEA 8VC, plus some really notable individuals like Opel CEO Kenneth Schlinker, Pinterest founder Evan Sharp, Carter CEO Henry Ward, and Lindy CEO Flo Carvelli, they all participated. Quite the list. And get this, Matt Craning from Menllo Ventures, who was actually an angel investor before, he's joining Whisper Flow's board now. Oh, interesting. So, he's doubling down. Yeah, exactly. That's a strong vote of confidence right there. And zooming out a bit, if we connect this to the bigger picture, this isn't just, you know, another funding round for another app, right? This kind of substantial investment signals a really strong belief in the foundational problem that Whisper Flow is trying to solve. The input problem. Yes. It's like a collective vote of confidence from the whole investment community saying, \"Yeah, our current ways of interacting with tech, they're holding us back. We need something better, faster, more natural.\" Exactly. The core problem Whisper Flow addresses is something we all kind of instinctively get, right, and often silently curse. Matt Craning from Menllo Ventures, the guy joining the board, he put it perfectly. He said that with current impert methods like keyboards, we are waiting for our thumbs to catch up with our thoughts. That's a great way to put it, isn't it? It's not just about typing speed, though. It's about preserving the um the fidelity of a spontaneous thought, right? The nuance. Yeah. When you have that brilliant idea or a complex sentence pops into your head or just a quick nuanced reply and then you have to translate that rapid fire thought into clumsy finger movements. You lose something in translation. You do. You lose nuance. Or maybe you just forget parts while your fingers are struggling. That's the real cost of this friction. Whisper flow basically proposes to bridge that gap. Let your natural speech become your direct input. But okay, this raises an important question. Yeah. How do they actually pull this off effectively? Because let's be honest, dictation has often been frustrating. Yeah. Historically, it's been hit or miss. Exactly. But the article highlights that this app captures user speech and crucially their intent. That's the key word, intent. Intent. Okay. Because, and this is a direct quote, the team has thought about how people speak while developing models rather than focusing on things like word error rates. Ah, so it's not just about getting every single word perfect. Precisely. It's a fundamental shift. It moves us away from that frustrating rigidity of older dictation systems, you know, where every or natural pause just threw it off completely. You had to speak like a robot. Yeah. Towards a future where the AI actually adapts to us, not the other way around. Mhm. Think of it less like a super meticulous transcriber focused only on words and more like a genuinely understanding assistant. One that gets the context, cleans up the natural messiness of how we actually talk. That's a huge difference for user experience. Huge. What's also incredibly interesting I found is Whisper Flow's origin story. Oh yeah. The founder and CEO Tan Kari initially started building Whisper with a well a much more ambitious hardware goal. Hardware. Okay. He actually wanted to create a device that would let users type just by mouthing words silently. Whoa. Silently, like no sound. Exactly. Imagine composing an entire email without making a sound or moving your fingers. Apparently, that's where some of their earlier funding went. That's wild sci-fi level stuff, right? But then last year, the company made a really strategic pivot. They shifted their main focus to Whisplow, the software interface. Okay. which was originally designed for that hardware concept, but now it's a standalone application. Okay, that makes sense. I'm really struck by that though, the software first approach, then maybe the hardware later. Does that suggest that the original mouthing words silently idea is still alive just you know on the back burner? That's a great question and it uh it speaks to a really common and often very wise pattern in tech startups, right? What's fascinating here and really smart is prioritizing the software. This pivot isn't unique. We see it a lot. It lets companies validate the market demand first. Test the waters. Exactly. Iterate quickly, build a user base before tackling the huge capital and logistical hurdles of hardware production, which are massive, enormous. It's often just the smarter, faster way to make an impact and scale up. And the article points out their rapid software release timeline Mac app in October 2024. Okay. Last fall, Windows app in March 2025, so just a few months ago. And their iOS app just came out earlier this month. Wow, that's fast across platforms. Yeah, that Swift roll out really shows their agility and their commitment to getting this tech into as many hands as possible quickly. And here's what I think of as kind of the secret sauce to Whisper Flow's early success. Okay, VCs, VCs in Silicon Valley have apparently been using the product themselves since its early days. uh the ultimate beta testers, right? It's not just a theoretical investment for them. It's something they're personally using, integrating into their daily workflow. That's powerful validation. Totally. TA Cathari himself shared, and I'm quoting here, I think every single tier 1 venture fund in the valley uses Whisper Flow for their emails, memos, documents, and more. They feel themselves being hooked on it. On it, huh? Yeah. He continued, \"Because of this, we started getting a lot of inbound interest for investment. So the usage drove the funding interest. It sounds like it. It's a powerful endorsement when the people funding cutting edge tech are actually using your product every day. Remind me a lot of granola actually. Yeah. They had a similar story, right? Investor interest fueled by personal use. Exactly. But okay. Does it also raise any potential concerns? Like are they just building a product for VCs or is this truly something with mass appeal beyond that you know very specific very connected user base? That's a really fair point and it's uh an important distinction to make. While that initial VC adoption was clearly a fantastic launchpad and great validation, sure, the article does make it clear they're aiming for mass appeal beyond that niche. And the numbers seem to back that up. Okay. What are the numbers saying? Well, the startup reports the app has been growing its user base by an impressive 50% month over month. 50% month over month. That's huge growth. It's significant. Yeah. Yeah. And looking at their global reach, it's not just a US thing. 40% of users are in the US, sure, but 30% are in Europe and another 30% in other parts of the world. So, you're pretty evenly spread globally. Exactly. But here's the crucial detail, I think, that really signals its mass appeal beyond just the tech early adopters. More than 30% of Whisperflow's users are from a non-technical background. Oh, okay. That is important. Yeah. This isn't just a tool for coders or engineers. It's proving valuable for writers, business people, students, really anyone who wants to quickly capture their thoughts. So the VC thing was maybe more about proof of concept and buzz. It suggests that yeah, proving the concept, generating buzz, yeah, rather than solely targeting that very specific market. That emphasis on accessibility really seems to set Whisper Flow apart then, doesn't it? It seems core to their mission. I mean, the app supports dictation in a staggering 104 languages. 104. That's incredible coverage. It really is. And what's even more remarkable to me anyway is the actual usage breakdown they shared. 40% of dictations are in English. Okay. Sizable chunk. But a full 60% are in other languages including Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Hindi, Mandarin. Wow. 60% non-English. That's actually amazing. It blew me away, too. It really makes you think about how many people globally are maybe held back by traditional keyboards or input methods that don't work well for their language. Absolutely. Kthari's vision seems crystal clear on this. He said, \"We are building for all kinds of users so they don't have to write system prompts to interface with AI.\" Ah, lowering the barrier to entry. Exactly. He explicitly contrasted this with the, you know, the command line chat GPT style interface that came out three and a half years ago. They want AI to be natural and intuitive for everyone, not just for people comfortable writing complex prompts, right? So hopefully no more frantic typing errors because my autocorrect decided to uh get creative with my professional email. We can only hope. And you know that vision is key. Which brings up an interesting strategic point mentioned in the article. What's that? If they were nearing profitability, why did Cathari decide to take on this big $30 million investment now? Good question. Why dilute if you're almost profitable? Well, he explained that he was worried. worried that the big tech players, you know, Google, Apple, Microsoft, with their massive distribution advantage and huge resources, just swoop in. Yeah. They could pose a significant risk to the company's future if Whisper didn't scale fast enough. So, the funding he decided was necessary to rapidly multiply the company's revenue and reach. Ah, defensive scaling makes sense, basically. Yeah. ensuring they can compete and really scale effectively against potentially much larger competitors entering the space. It's a calculated move to accelerate growth and sort of fortify their position. And with that fresh $30 million, Whisper Flow has a really ambitious future roadmap laid out. I bet what's on it? Well, first they plan to use the capital to significantly grow their team. Makes sense. Focusing heavily on engineering and go to market roles, standard scaling playbook for software, right? We'll also apparently see an Android app release soon. Oh, good. Expanding beyond Apple and desktops. Yeah. Opening up another massive user base. And beyond that, they're looking to cater more seriously to enterprise users. How so? By setting up things like companywide phrase context so the AI understands specific company jargon or names and providing dedicated support teams, making it a truly viable solution for businesses wanting to boost productivity across the board. Okay, that enterprise angle is smart. big potential market there. But what's truly fascinating here, I think, is the ultimate vision for flow. It's not just about dictation, right? You mentioned intent earlier. Exactly. They're working on building it into an AI powered assistant that knows more about your personal context. Personal context. What does that mean exactly? Imagine an AI that really understands your work, your communication style, your common context, your preferences. Okay? And can then help you with everyday tasks. sending messages, taking notes, setting reminders seamlessly through voice without you having to constantly reexplain yourself or issue very specific rigid commands. Ah, so it learns you precisely. I remember, you know, struggling to type detailed notes during a fast-paced meeting, constantly losing the thread of the actual conversation. Yeah, happens all the time. This kind of tech aims to completely remove that friction, let you stay fully present. Plus, uh, the article notes they're already working with unnamed AI hardware partners. Mhm. The hardware angle isn't dead. It seems not. They're working with partners to power the interaction layer, which strongly suggests that initial hardware ambition of the silent mouththing device maybe might still be part of the long-term strategy, perhaps just not built by Whisper themselves directly. Interesting. So maybe licensing their software to hardware makers. Could be. It's a very holistic approach. thinking about software context and the hardware interaction layer, integrating AI really deeply into our lives. Okay, so wrapping this up then, what does this all mean for you, the listener? We've seen how the voice AI market is clearly booming, right? Attracting massive investment across both the underlying tech and the practical apps. Definitely a hot space. We've taken a deep dive into Whisper Flow's really innovative approach, bridging that frustrating gap between your thoughts and actually getting them down digitally, moving us closer to truly natural interaction with our devices. Their impressive growth, especially with non-technical users, and that commitment to making AI accessible globally, not just for techies, signals a pretty significant shift, I think, in how we might all engage with technology very soon. It really does. It's about making the tech kind of disappear into the background. So your ideas can just flow effortlessly. And this raises, I think, an important final question for you to ponder long after our deep dive ends. Okay. How might an AI powered assistant, one that truly understands your personal context fundamentally change your daily interactions with technology? Consider how that profound shift from, you know, waiting for your thumbs to catch up with your thoughts to seamless natural language input could unlock entirely new levels of productivity, maybe even creativity for everyone, regardless of their technical background. What could you accomplish if your thoughts could flow directly into action with uh basically no digital friction in between?"
