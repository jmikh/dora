I started using it a while ago for school because I started school in September, and it is so, so, so, so useful for my productivity. The best part is, if you're a student, you get three free months of premium, and then after that, it's $6/month, which is incredibly cheap AI subscription these days.\n\n\n\nSo, that's why  it was just really useful for me. Helps a lot. Use my referral link, please! It would really help because then I can get more months. But it is genuinely such a time saver.  By the way, it only works on Windows, Mac, and iOS. There's no web extension or anything like that, but it is genuinely such a time saver. And honestly, I don't know how I could have made it throughout the school year without it.\n\n[https://wisprflow.ai/r?JOEL469](https://wisprflow.ai/r?JOEL469)",

        "body": "I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have. It just works—and it works really well.",

It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool.

But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. \n\nThis app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived. I used this for 5 minutes before I was like, \"this is just going to be part of my life now. It's that good.\" You see what it did there? It added quotes automatically. Incredible.",

So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.\n\nWhen using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say. So you have less chance of having confusing messages.",
