What you are going to find, surprisingly, is it's just a really new way to interact with your iOS device, because you'll find yourself just speaking to your phone through this keyboard.\n\nNot only is it faster (saving you time), but it really understands the context of where you're speaking to through your keyboard, whether that's over a text or a message or Instagram or an email or journaling. It's just so easy and it's so great at getting the spellings right, especially with unique names and so on. You could spell it out and it won't transcribe it word-for-word, but it will get the context and just update it.\n\nSo long story short, this is more of a ghostwriter disguised as an AI product.",

            "body": "Issues with Messaging Integration, Activation Delay, and macOS Installation\n\nDescription:\nYesterday, the app worked seamlessly with text messaging. Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

So if I'm just on the go or trying to send someone a message or trying to look up something really quickly, I can't always have 100% perfect silence.\n\nThis needs to be more robust to noise and work better with software/hardware such as AirPods, etc. It also needs to work for longer form content which is in particular an issue on the iOS app, not so much on Mac OS. I don't know if the issue is because after use it for a while it becomes slower because the required inference time or something is an issue. I don't know what it is.

At first, everything was great, but lately the app’s performance on Windows has gotten much worse.\n\nThe biggest problem is that it often freezes, and when it does, it can also freeze whatever app I’m working in. At first, I thought it was the fault of the apps themselves (like having too many browser tabs open), but when Notepad++ started freezing too, it became really irritating.\n\nThis might be related to my use case - I use voice input together with editing and pasting new text. When I’m using Wispr Flow and paste from the clipboard with Ctrl+V, these freezes start happening. Sometimes the cursor even jumps around unexpectedly.\n\nI also use the Windows feature “Clipboard History” (Windows key + V) quite a lot. Another issue is that I often use voice input with languages that have non-Latin scripts, and Wispr Flow completely messes up the copied text in those languages. For example, it records the message I dictated \"I’m talking about Wispr Flow\", then copies the previous message \"Лісьце ў пушчы як цудоўны ложак\", but changes its encoding into something like \"Ë³ñüöå ¢ ïóø÷û ÿê öóäî¢íû ëîæàê\".\n\nThe encoding issue is annoying but tolerable. The freezes, however, are driving me crazy.\n\nHas anyone here used voice input apps for Windows that combine AI with speech recognition? I don’t need commands - just plain text dictation.",

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

And for those who've never tried Wispr Flow or don't understand what I'm talking about this is what I mean. \n\nWhen I use the apple built-in voice to text and said something like \"hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 4 PM no I'm sorry 3 PM at that new restaurant in downtown Indianapolis I'm sorry Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new talent bench\" It would type it out for word. \n\nHowever, when I use Wispr Flow and say the same thing, it would correct it to \"Hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 3PM at that new restaurant in downtown Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new Talent Bench.\"\n\nI've tried Spokenly, the Apple Wispr app, and one other one that I can't remember, and none of them do that. Is there one that does? \n\nI am 99.9% happy with Wispr Flow. There was a bug like a month ago where it wouldn't catch the first or second word. But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me.

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

This model is super fast and capable, in Superwhisper desktop I add this as a custom API endpoint.\n\nThe thing with Kimi K2 is that it likes to freestyle a bit with long content. So if I'm dictating something beyond a couple of minutes, I'll switch to a different mode using the same prompt with GPT-5. Most of the time for dictation transcriptions, I'm jumping between those two modes—GPT5 for for lengthy dictations, and Kimi K2 for quick communication.\n\nI do have some other prompts I use more for assistance or coding help, and for that I'll use Sonnet. But the other two are the ones I use most.\n\nUnfortunately on iOS we still don't have the ability to add custom AI models, so I just stick to GPT-5. I've seen that I also get pretty good results with GPT-4.1, but the difference in speed is almost negligible from what I've tested, so I just go with GPT-5. GPT 4.1 or GPT5 are actually very good at following instructions with complex requirements—much better than Sonnet or even Haiku.",

The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing.

Like it misses a lot of words and sentences. So I just use the built-in microphone on my laptop.

Why I turn Flow on from the in-app toggle:\nI have Wispr Flow set to immediately turn off after each message. That means I have to manually tap “Start Flow” every single time I want to speak, which quickly becomes annoying and time-consuming. Turning Flow on from the in-app toggle is my way of trying to keep it active so I don’t have to keep restarting it.\n\n2. What I want it to do:\nWhen I manually toggle Flow on, I expect it to stay active until I either turn it off myself or close the app — regardless of the “immediately turn off” setting. Essentially, the toggle should act as a manual override that keeps Flow running continuously.\n\nSo in short:\n\t•\tThe toggle should override the “immediate turn off” setting.\n\t•\tOnce turned on, Flow should stay active until I manually stop it.",

The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have.

It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool.

Sometimes the cursor even jumps around unexpectedly.\n\nI also use the Windows feature “Clipboard History” (Windows key + V) quite a lot. Another issue is that I often use voice input with languages that have non-Latin scripts, and Wispr Flow completely messes up the copied text in those languages. For example, it records the message I dictated \"I’m talking about Wispr Flow\", then copies the previous message \"Лісьце ў пушчы як цудоўны ложак\", but changes its encoding into something like \"Ë³ñüöå ¢ ïóø÷û ÿê öóäî¢íû ëîæàê\".\n\nThe encoding issue is annoying but tolerable. The freezes, however, are driving me crazy.\n\nHas anyone here used voice input apps for Windows that combine AI with speech recognition? I don’t need commands - just plain text dictation.",

I assume they use Whisper.cpp or Parakeet so in terms of transcription speed and accuracy it’s probably similar.\n\nFrom quickly looking at their feature lists we overlap on most core features. The main things that currently stand out in Vowen that I can say are:\n\n1. Generating summaries for ongoing Zoom or Google Meet calls by capturing audio + periodic screenshots  \n2. Voice triggered automations that launch apps/websites or sequences of actions. It's still in beta right now, but the idea is to be able to automate repetitive flows with this. \n\n\\----\n\nYes, it's an electron app. We are building this for fun on the side from our day job. The overhead of writing two different apps for different platforms is a lot of effort honestly 😅. So we decided to go with Electron.

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

So if I'm dictating something beyond a couple of minutes, I'll switch to a different mode using the same prompt with GPT-5. Most of the time for dictation transcriptions, I'm jumping between those two modes—GPT5 for for lengthy dictations, and Kimi K2 for quick communication.\n\nI do have some other prompts I use more for assistance or coding help, and for that I'll use Sonnet. But the other two are the ones I use most.\n\nUnfortunately on iOS we still don't have the ability to add custom AI models, so I just stick to GPT-5. I've seen that I also get pretty good results with GPT-4.1, but the difference in speed is almost negligible from what I've tested, so I just go with GPT-5.

Like it misses a lot of words and sentences. So I just use the built-in microphone on my laptop. And because of this, it makes working in public spaces, especially in a really loud environment, kind of challenging because the microphone is trying to pick up all the distracting noises in the background along with my voice so it sometimes misses a lot of key words or even sentences. \n\nSo I generally try and find a more quiet space and I speak at a more moderate volume.",

It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have. It just works—and it works really well.",

It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool.

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. \n\nThe simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well.",

So I would have to put my phone up near my mouth and whisper if I need to send a quick text message or email somebody or take some notes, etc. So for me anyways, Because of the way I set it up, it never uses the AirPods microphone.\n\nAs for using it on the laptop, I don't know why but my AirPods microphone don't pick up too well and it doesn't  work too well with wispr flow. Like it misses a lot of words and sentences. So I just use the built-in microphone on my laptop. And because of this, it makes working in public spaces, especially in a really loud environment, kind of challenging because the microphone is trying to pick up all the distracting noises in the background along with my voice so it sometimes misses a lot of key words or even sentences. \n\nSo I generally try and find a more quiet space and I speak at a more moderate volume.",

I have bigger hands, and as I'm getting older, over 55, it's harder to see the little phone and it's hard to type. So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.\n\nWhen using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say. So you have less chance of having confusing messages.",

It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have.

Perhaps this is a problem with AirPods, but truly I cannot keep on losing very important transcripts. I'm not always in a perfectly quiet environment. So if I'm just on the go or trying to send someone a message or trying to look up something really quickly, I can't always have 100% perfect silence.\n\nThis needs to be more robust to noise and work better with software/hardware such as AirPods, etc. It also needs to work for longer form content which is in particular an issue on the iOS app, not so much on Mac OS. I don't know if the issue is because after use it for a while it becomes slower because the required inference time or something is an issue. I don't know what it is.

            "body": "Hey folks! 👋\n\nI've been testing **Wispr Flow** for a while now, and honestly, it's become part of my daily workflow. As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. \n\nThe simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well.",

One thing I really liked about Willow, though, was its command mode. For example, if you started a dictation with “Hey Willow”, you could then say things like “Compose a message” or “Edit some other text”, and it would carry out those actions.\n\nA workflow I often used was dictating some text, then highlighting it and asking Willow to rewrite it — making it clearer, more formal, or more concise. That functionality was incredibly useful, and I’d love to know if anything like this is on the roadmap for Flow.\n\nI’ve logged well over 300,000 words on Flow so far, and I’d be happy to help beta test these kinds of features, or any other new capabilities you have in the pipeline.",

It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling.

It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool.

Perhaps this is a problem with AirPods, but truly I cannot keep on losing very important transcripts. I'm not always in a perfectly quiet environment. So if I'm just on the go or trying to send someone a message or trying to look up something really quickly, I can't always have 100% perfect silence.\n\nThis needs to be more robust to noise and work better with software/hardware such as AirPods, etc. It also needs to work for longer form content which is in particular an issue on the iOS app, not so much on Mac OS. I don't know if the issue is because after use it for a while it becomes slower because the required inference time or something is an issue. I don't know what it is.

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

The thing that did it for me was how it recognizes when I make a mistake and fixes it. Do any of the other alternative voice-to-text apps do that? And for those who've never tried Wispr Flow or don't understand what I'm talking about this is what I mean. \n\nWhen I use the apple built-in voice to text and said something like \"hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 4 PM no I'm sorry 3 PM at that new restaurant in downtown Indianapolis I'm sorry Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new talent bench\" It would type it out for word. \n\nHowever, when I use Wispr Flow and say the same thing, it would correct it to \"Hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 3PM at that new restaurant in downtown Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new Talent Bench.\"\n\nI've tried Spokenly, the Apple Wispr app, and one other one that I can't remember, and none of them do that. Is there one that does? \n\nI am 99.9% happy with Wispr Flow. There was a bug like a month ago where it wouldn't catch the first or second word. But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me.

So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful!

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

Helps a lot. Use my referral link, please! It would really help because then I can get more months. But it is genuinely such a time saver.  By the way, it only works on Windows, Mac, and iOS.

            "body": "I’m using Wispr Flow on Windows. Because of a disability and a speech impairment I speak a bit slower, and Flow has been a big help for speed and accuracy. However, when I dictate longer passages, Flow starts inserting blank lines between sentences. This is the case in every app. I'm writing an essay, and it's important that I stay in the same paragraph. My current workaround is to stop dictation after each sentence and start it again; it prevents the extra line, but it slows me down and breaks my rhythm. Is there a way to force continuous text in a single paragraph (i.e., never send Enter unless I explicitly press it)? Thanks! ",

The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing.

But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. \n\nThis app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived. I used this for 5 minutes before I was like, \"this is just going to be part of my life now. It's that good.\" You see what it did there? It added quotes automatically. Incredible.",

I have bigger hands, and as I'm getting older, over 55, it's harder to see the little phone and it's hard to type. So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.\n\nWhen using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say.

However, when I dictate longer passages, Flow starts inserting blank lines between sentences.

My current workaround is to stop dictation after each sentence and start it again; it prevents the extra line, but it slows me down and breaks my rhythm.

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

Kinda similar to how Wispr Flow uses Smart AI formatting where you can change your mind mid-sentence and dictation and it would implement the changes without adding all the jargon and filler words. \n\nBecause I really like that feature that Wispr Flow has. And I don't know if any of the models in Spokenly have that feature or not, or if I have to come up with my own AI post-processing prompt to clean up my text a bit and transcriptions and dictations to make it sound better or more clear. \n\nDo you happen to have a good AI prompt for post-processing or know anywhere I can get already pre-made prompts that work very well, especially for voice dictation?",

Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have. It just works—and it works really well.",

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think!

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think!

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

So if I'm dictating something beyond a couple of minutes, I'll switch to a different mode using the same prompt with GPT-5. Most of the time for dictation transcriptions, I'm jumping between those two modes—GPT5 for for lengthy dictations, and Kimi K2 for quick communication.\n\nI do have some other prompts I use more for assistance or coding help, and for that I'll use Sonnet. But the other two are the ones I use most.\n\nUnfortunately on iOS we still don't have the ability to add custom AI models, so I just stick to GPT-5. I've seen that I also get pretty good results with GPT-4.1, but the difference in speed is almost negligible from what I've tested, so I just go with GPT-5.

So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

But other than that, you can turn it off and it’s super easy to get back on while you’re texting.

The thing that did it for me was how it recognizes when I make a mistake and fixes it. Do any of the other alternative voice-to-text apps do that? And for those who've never tried Wispr Flow or don't understand what I'm talking about this is what I mean. \n\nWhen I use the apple built-in voice to text and said something like \"hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 4 PM no I'm sorry 3 PM at that new restaurant in downtown Indianapolis I'm sorry Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new talent bench\" It would type it out for word. \n\nHowever, when I use Wispr Flow and say the same thing, it would correct it to \"Hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 3PM at that new restaurant in downtown Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new Talent Bench.\"\n\nI've tried Spokenly, the Apple Wispr app, and one other one that I can't remember, and none of them do that. Is there one that does? \n\nI am 99.9% happy with Wispr Flow. There was a bug like a month ago where it wouldn't catch the first or second word. But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me. And that's why I was wondering if any of the other apps did it.",
