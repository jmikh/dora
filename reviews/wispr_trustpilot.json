It keeps all placeholders, does not have any context (like the email thread), so its pretty useless. GPT is for free and so much better. Please let me know when you have real AI enabled.",

Improve your English level if you are another native speaker because you're starting not typing but saying something and thinking about the wording itself, and it's pretty cool.\n2. Text with somebody much faster and in the proper way because it also does all the grammatical stuff and aligns with your writing habits.",

If you make a mistake or repeat yourself, Wispr Flow recognizes that, and your dictation is corrected. It's awesome. So, why the 3-star review and not a 5-star review? Sometimes, when you dictate, you may not get the dictation for 20-30 seconds or at all. This tends to be the case when you have a longer dictation and you are in part of the day that might be busier for their servers. ",

Trying everything, the shortcuts that are provided by them aren't working. I have the team subscription, and one of the features of the team's subscription is that you get support within one business day, which is simply a lie. It's been now a few days, and I'm trying to reach out to them. My team and I are having simple bugs, and it doesn't work like it should. I'm not able to use it more than a week, and there is no one to talk to although I extra paid for support within one business day.",

I have written several emails and made reports. They are probably trying to fix it because yesterday I saw a slight improvement, but in reality, even with the paid subscription I took out, I have not been able to use the product for over a week.\nLike all start-ups, they obviously don't have a minimum number of staff or anyone who can respond or a contact person who can give you guarantees. It may all be done with artificial intelligence or in a “fantasy world” that no one knows about, and you have no chance of getting in touch with someone who can solve the problem.",
