It's just so easy and it's so great at getting the spellings right, especially with unique names and so on.

I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have.

This tool has saved so much time as I spend on the road, driving to and from appointments. I have now truly become hands-free. I work in the real estate industry, and I can honestly say that this app would help realtors everywhere. Aside from that, I even use it to write my Yelp reviews and notes for the grocery store, using it in ChatGPT, text messages, writing emails - you name it. So much less time spent with my thumbs on my phone just using my voice. Definitely worth every penny.",

Typing has always been one of those bottlenecks in my day, emails, proposals, notes, you name it. With Wispr Flow, that bottleneck is gone. It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool. It’s become a core part of how I work every single day, on my Apple mobile devices, my MacBook and my Desktop. If you’re serious about improving workflow and making better use of your time, it’s a no-brainer.",

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful!

This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. \n\nThe simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well.",

Helps a lot. Use my referral link, please! It would really help because then I can get more months. But it is genuinely such a time saver.  By the way, it only works on Windows, Mac, and iOS. There's no web extension or anything like that, but it is genuinely such a time saver.

You just select the one you want, and it inserts it in line. Bonus points if you can organize them by folders or tags or something. \n\nI know that this is kind of beyond the scope of Wispr Flow because it's a voice app, but it would make it so much easier to recall and bring up different snippets. \n\nOne common use case that I have is not just for coaching links, but for example, I answer a lot of people's questions online, and many times the answer to a question involves a link to one of my YouTube videos. So I have to go now and look up the video, copy the share link, and then paste it in my response. It would be amazing if I could simply say \"my video on such-and-such topic\" and it brings up that URL automatically. \n\nMaybe I am going into rag territory here. This is one idea that I mentioned to you on Twitter a while ago. For example, when I mention in my speech something about coaching link or whatever, something that might match one of my snippets, at the end of dictation it would pop up a menu with suggested snippets to include based on the keywords that I mentioned.",

I wish Apple would not require app switching, but other than that it works wonders and it's very easy to use. You will not go wrong with this application. It makes working on your phone much faster. I can talk way faster than I can ever type on my phone. And Wispr Flow really captures the meaning of what I'm trying to say. I can talk in little segments, edit, and move my cursor around, and it will paste in whatever I transcribed into that section. It's lickety-split fast.

Storing everything locally adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSecondly, from a history perspective, I personally always go back to my history and either look at what I previously typed to remember what I was working on, or if I lose access to something or accidentally forget where and what I did with something that I typed. It makes it super easy just to go to my transcription history and see exactly what I typed. Thirdly, to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory.\n\nThird of all, I think this opens the door to more personalization. If you store the transcription history, you can use it as training data to make a more custom, fine-tuned model for each user. The transcription in AI Polish is more tailored towards their style, vocabulary, and preferences, making it a more magical experience for the user. I understand that all users may not want this, but for the ones that do, it could be good to have. \n\nAnd finally, yes, I would love to have the ability to search my old notes, maybe for the past week or month. I sometimes have a vague recollection of me previously writing something, and being able to go back and check would be extremely helpful.\n\nFinally, for the mobile-to-desktop users, I think an instant sync would be extremely helpful for everyone who's not on a Mac. Syncing what you have on mobile to desktop is a little difficult. If you could almost recreate that with your app I think it can be really helpful. The way I imagine it is I could voice-type something on my phone and then paste it on my laptop. This could be especially useful in situations where you can't verbally speak to your laptop out loud, but you can quietly whisper into the bottom of your phone.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or follow-ups, please feel free to reach out.",

            "body": "I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

In certain situations, I would be happier to wait a few extra seconds for the longer transcription, for it to be for me to have to do less with the output when it's done. For example, in situations like with my email, I would happily wait a few extra seconds for it to also output per my exact custom email template. \n\nAnother suggestion is this is something that the command mode could handle. Command mode already takes an extra few seconds to do the AI processing, and I would love to see giving command mode access to some custom templates or formats that I can reference via voice commands when editing my text.",

However, a personal message to the developers and the marketing team. This is a keyboard app. I don't need recurring marketing emails sent to me multiple times after I download the app. I don't need notifications popping up on my phone from this app telling me about your other features. I know you're trying to make it more than a keyboard app, but literally just market to your super consumers. You're a keyboard app that has perfected speech-to-text. It is the best speech-to-text app and keyboard on the App Store by far. We don't need notifications, we don't need marketing emails - like you built a really, really great app, focus on that. Don't annoy your customers with emails and notifications that they don't want because it's just annoying and it really takes away from the great app that you guys built.\n\nIf the purpose of the notifications and email marketing is to drive people to purchase the pro version, just stop. Charge people $3 for the app - one-time purchase, unlimited use. This is the best keyboard app on the market, but you're annoying your customers with all of the notifications and the emails. And you could definitely charge people for this app, and I guarantee you, people will pay money for it. It is that good. But you need to seriously shift your strategy because you're not going to make money selling this pro notes feature. It's just not going to happen for you guys. You built a really great keyboard app, congratulations. Charge people $2, $3, even $5 for it because I guarantee you, word of mouth is going to get around and this app is going to blow up, and you're going to have no one pay for the pro version, and you're going to be stuck with this huge AI bill. If you just charge people a small amount of money up front for unlimited use, you're going to be fine. Please heed my advice.",

Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have.

That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   \n\nUnfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    \n\nFrustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. \n\nBut I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. \n\nI look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here..",

The thing that did it for me was how it recognizes when I make a mistake and fixes it. Do any of the other alternative voice-to-text apps do that? And for those who've never tried Wispr Flow or don't understand what I'm talking about this is what I mean. \n\nWhen I use the apple built-in voice to text and said something like \"hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 4 PM no I'm sorry 3 PM at that new restaurant in downtown Indianapolis I'm sorry Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new talent bench\" It would type it out for word. \n\nHowever, when I use Wispr Flow and say the same thing, it would correct it to \"Hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 3PM at that new restaurant in downtown Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new Talent Bench.\"\n\nI've tried Spokenly, the Apple Wispr app, and one other one that I can't remember, and none of them do that. Is there one that does? \n\nI am 99.9% happy with Wispr Flow. There was a bug like a month ago where it wouldn't catch the first or second word. But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me. And that's why I was wondering if any of the other apps did it.",

            "body": "Voice dictation has single handedly 2Xed my productivity over the last month! So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?",

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing.

But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. \n\nThis app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived. I used this for 5 minutes before I was like, \"this is just going to be part of my life now. It's that good.\" You see what it did there? It added quotes automatically. Incredible.",

So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.\n\nWhen using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say.

My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. \n\nSince switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application.

            "body": "I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

            "body": "I’m using Wispr Flow on Windows. Because of a disability and a speech impairment I speak a bit slower, and Flow has been a big help for speed and accuracy. However, when I dictate longer passages, Flow starts inserting blank lines between sentences. This is the case in every app. I'm writing an essay, and it's important that I stay in the same paragraph. My current workaround is to stop dictation after each sentence and start it again; it prevents the extra line, but it slows me down and breaks my rhythm. Is there a way to force continuous text in a single paragraph (i.e., never send Enter unless I explicitly press it)? Thanks! ",

It's just so easy and it's so great at getting the spellings right, especially with unique names and so on.

It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling.

Typing has always been one of those bottlenecks in my day, emails, proposals, notes, you name it. With Wispr Flow, that bottleneck is gone. It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool. It’s become a core part of how I work every single day, on my Apple mobile devices, my MacBook and my Desktop. If you’re serious about improving workflow and making better use of your time, it’s a no-brainer.",

You just select the one you want, and it inserts it in line. Bonus points if you can organize them by folders or tags or something. \n\nI know that this is kind of beyond the scope of Wispr Flow because it's a voice app, but it would make it so much easier to recall and bring up different snippets. \n\nOne common use case that I have is not just for coaching links, but for example, I answer a lot of people's questions online, and many times the answer to a question involves a link to one of my YouTube videos. So I have to go now and look up the video, copy the share link, and then paste it in my response. It would be amazing if I could simply say \"my video on such-and-such topic\" and it brings up that URL automatically. \n\nMaybe I am going into rag territory here. This is one idea that I mentioned to you on Twitter a while ago. For example, when I mention in my speech something about coaching link or whatever, something that might match one of my snippets, at the end of dictation it would pop up a menu with suggested snippets to include based on the keywords that I mentioned.",

I can talk in little segments, edit, and move my cursor around, and it will paste in whatever I transcribed into that section. It's lickety-split fast.

Storing everything locally adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSecondly, from a history perspective, I personally always go back to my history and either look at what I previously typed to remember what I was working on, or if I lose access to something or accidentally forget where and what I did with something that I typed. It makes it super easy just to go to my transcription history and see exactly what I typed. Thirdly, to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory.\n\nThird of all, I think this opens the door to more personalization. If you store the transcription history, you can use it as training data to make a more custom, fine-tuned model for each user. The transcription in AI Polish is more tailored towards their style, vocabulary, and preferences, making it a more magical experience for the user. I understand that all users may not want this, but for the ones that do, it could be good to have. \n\nAnd finally, yes, I would love to have the ability to search my old notes, maybe for the past week or month. I sometimes have a vague recollection of me previously writing something, and being able to go back and check would be extremely helpful.\n\nFinally, for the mobile-to-desktop users, I think an instant sync would be extremely helpful for everyone who's not on a Mac. Syncing what you have on mobile to desktop is a little difficult. If you could almost recreate that with your app I think it can be really helpful. The way I imagine it is I could voice-type something on my phone and then paste it on my laptop. This could be especially useful in situations where you can't verbally speak to your laptop out loud, but you can quietly whisper into the bottom of your phone.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or follow-ups, please feel free to reach out.",

Exactly what kind of access does this permission grant? Couldn’t get past the account setup sequence without granting full access, so rating 4 stars because it seems like an intelligent execution of a voice app, and it has a nice UI.

However, a personal message to the developers and the marketing team. This is a keyboard app. I don't need recurring marketing emails sent to me multiple times after I download the app. I don't need notifications popping up on my phone from this app telling me about your other features. I know you're trying to make it more than a keyboard app, but literally just market to your super consumers. You're a keyboard app that has perfected speech-to-text. It is the best speech-to-text app and keyboard on the App Store by far. We don't need notifications, we don't need marketing emails - like you built a really, really great app, focus on that. Don't annoy your customers with emails and notifications that they don't want because it's just annoying and it really takes away from the great app that you guys built.\n\nIf the purpose of the notifications and email marketing is to drive people to purchase the pro version, just stop. Charge people $3 for the app - one-time purchase, unlimited use. This is the best keyboard app on the market, but you're annoying your customers with all of the notifications and the emails. And you could definitely charge people for this app, and I guarantee you, people will pay money for it. It is that good. But you need to seriously shift your strategy because you're not going to make money selling this pro notes feature. It's just not going to happen for you guys. You built a really great keyboard app, congratulations. Charge people $2, $3, even $5 for it because I guarantee you, word of mouth is going to get around and this app is going to blow up, and you're going to have no one pay for the pro version, and you're going to be stuck with this huge AI bill. If you just charge people a small amount of money up front for unlimited use, you're going to be fine. Please heed my advice.",

Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

It’s fast, incredibly accurate, and impressively intuitive. I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have.

It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool.

            "body": "Hey folks! 👋\n\nI've been testing **Wispr Flow** for a while now, and honestly, it's become part of my daily workflow. As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful!

Spokenly is a solid alternative that can do a lot of what Wispr Flow does—free if you use local models or bring your own API keys. There's also Ito AI, which is basically an open-source copy of Wispr Flow (less powerful, but maybe you don't need \"powerful\" right now). If you need more power and customization there's VoiceInk, Superwhisper (my favorite), and a bunch more.\n\nHonestly, there are A LOT of alternatives.\n\nEDIT. BTW. If you are looking for something that is iOS as well, then your options will be a bit more limited. Wispr Flow/Spokenly/Superwhisper. Out of those three my fav on iOS is Spokenly, but Superwhisper has a new version on Testflight and it's really nice—not sure when will it be released. There's also VoiceInk for iOS but last I tried it was too buggy, perhaps it's better now.",

I love Voice AI top 2% of Flow users for the past several months. \n\nHence, I am building a voice AI management companion to help individuals become the best versions of themselves. I started with using chat GPT's Whisper - 1 model. This was a disaster. \n\nI then one day had an idea and epiphany really to start relying on Wispr Flow entirely. My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. \n\nSince switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application.

Storing everything locally adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSecondly, from a history perspective, I personally always go back to my history and either look at what I previously typed to remember what I was working on, or if I lose access to something or accidentally forget where and what I did with something that I typed. It makes it super easy just to go to my transcription history and see exactly what I typed. Thirdly, to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory.\n\nThird of all, I think this opens the door to more personalization. If you store the transcription history, you can use it as training data to make a more custom, fine-tuned model for each user. The transcription in AI Polish is more tailored towards their style, vocabulary, and preferences, making it a more magical experience for the user. I understand that all users may not want this, but for the ones that do, it could be good to have. \n\nAnd finally, yes, I would love to have the ability to search my old notes, maybe for the past week or month. I sometimes have a vague recollection of me previously writing something, and being able to go back and check would be extremely helpful.\n\nFinally, for the mobile-to-desktop users, I think an instant sync would be extremely helpful for everyone who's not on a Mac. Syncing what you have on mobile to desktop is a little difficult. If you could almost recreate that with your app I think it can be really helpful. The way I imagine it is I could voice-type something on my phone and then paste it on my laptop. This could be especially useful in situations where you can't verbally speak to your laptop out loud, but you can quietly whisper into the bottom of your phone.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or follow-ups, please feel free to reach out.",

            "body": "Hey Wispr Flow team and community!\n\nI’d love to see cloud sync functionality added for our transcription history. Right now, each device stores everything locally, and I think having our transcripts synced across all devices would be a game-changer.\n\n**Why this would be useful:**\n\n1. **Access history anywhere** - Being able to view and search through my transcription history on my phone, computer, or any device where I use Wispr Flow would be incredibly convenient.\n2. **Storage concerns** - Local storage is becoming a real issue. My phone already has over 1GB of documents just for the app, and I can’t even imagine how much my computer has accumulated. Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage.\n2. **Backup and peace of mind** - If something happens to one device, I wouldn’t lose all my transcription history.\n\nOf course, I understand this will be implemented as an optional feature that users can opt into if they’re comfortable sharing their transcription data and history with Wispr. That way, users who prioritize privacy can continue using local-only storage while those of us who want the convenience can take advantage of cloud sync.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experiencing similar storage issues or would find this useful!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

So I just let it go. \n\nBut I saw an interview with the Founder/CEO on the Paperless Movement channel, which I just love. This guy really impressed me. \n\nI tried again today, and oh my goodness, am I ever glad I did. \n\nThis is a complete game changer for me. In fact, I am writing this post by whispering it because it's late, and it just works perfectly. Not one mistake. \n\nWhatever you guys did over the past few months has really brought this up to speed. I could not be happier. \n\nI'm using this across all three of my devices: my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. And it is just flawless. \n\nCould not recommend this enough! This gets my highest vote! ",

That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   \n\nUnfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    \n\nFrustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. \n\nBut I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. \n\nI look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here..",

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

And for those who've never tried Wispr Flow or don't understand what I'm talking about this is what I mean. \n\nWhen I use the apple built-in voice to text and said something like \"hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 4 PM no I'm sorry 3 PM at that new restaurant in downtown Indianapolis I'm sorry Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new talent bench\" It would type it out for word. \n\nHowever, when I use Wispr Flow and say the same thing, it would correct it to \"Hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 3PM at that new restaurant in downtown Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new Talent Bench.\"\n\nI've tried Spokenly, the Apple Wispr app, and one other one that I can't remember, and none of them do that. Is there one that does? \n\nI am 99.9% happy with Wispr Flow. There was a bug like a month ago where it wouldn't catch the first or second word. But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me.

It only felt fair to give this update since I ripped into them last time around lol\n\nTL;DR, their explanations for the lapse in support seemed fair (caught them in the middle of a customer service transition) and the hiccups with the tool (they were blocked by a whole country lol). Also I didn't enjoy the other providers, they're just missing the oomph...\n\nSo basically, it seems like everything was going wrong for them at the same time for them. That's their explanation, at least which I kind of believe because some of the things seem to be consistent with what my friends were also experiencing. For example, apparently the UAE blocked their server or something, and no one in the country was able to log in, which was actually the root of my disdain. Also did not help that their support was not responsive, their explanation was they'd been changing up the customer service setup during this time. In any case, whether or not that's true, they've been super responsive of late and Im back to it being reliable.\n\nAlso, one last thing I wanted to say, which is also why I'm creating this post, is because what's kind of scary is that I tried all the other providers, and they do not come close to what Wispr Flow is offering. It's just little nuances are missed, it doesn't feel natural. It's scary because if they don't turn things around, Wispr Flow might literally be just monopolizing this whole sector. As it stands, it's pretty good, and my main gripes with them are resolved. So yeah I'm back to recommending them and everything's good again in the universe. ",

Kinda similar to how Wispr Flow uses Smart AI formatting where you can change your mind mid-sentence and dictation and it would implement the changes without adding all the jargon and filler words. \n\nBecause I really like that feature that Wispr Flow has. And I don't know if any of the models in Spokenly have that feature or not, or if I have to come up with my own AI post-processing prompt to clean up my text a bit and transcriptions and dictations to make it sound better or more clear. \n\nDo you happen to have a good AI prompt for post-processing or know anywhere I can get already pre-made prompts that work very well, especially for voice dictation?",

You just select the one you want, and it inserts it in line. Bonus points if you can organize them by folders or tags or something. \n\nI know that this is kind of beyond the scope of Wispr Flow because it's a voice app, but it would make it so much easier to recall and bring up different snippets. \n\nOne common use case that I have is not just for coaching links, but for example, I answer a lot of people's questions online, and many times the answer to a question involves a link to one of my YouTube videos. So I have to go now and look up the video, copy the share link, and then paste it in my response. It would be amazing if I could simply say \"my video on such-and-such topic\" and it brings up that URL automatically. \n\nMaybe I am going into rag territory here. This is one idea that I mentioned to you on Twitter a while ago.

It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. \n\nThis app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived.

Storing everything locally adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSecondly, from a history perspective, I personally always go back to my history and either look at what I previously typed to remember what I was working on, or if I lose access to something or accidentally forget where and what I did with something that I typed. It makes it super easy just to go to my transcription history and see exactly what I typed. Thirdly, to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory.\n\nThird of all, I think this opens the door to more personalization. If you store the transcription history, you can use it as training data to make a more custom, fine-tuned model for each user. The transcription in AI Polish is more tailored towards their style, vocabulary, and preferences, making it a more magical experience for the user. I understand that all users may not want this, but for the ones that do, it could be good to have. \n\nAnd finally, yes, I would love to have the ability to search my old notes, maybe for the past week or month. I sometimes have a vague recollection of me previously writing something, and being able to go back and check would be extremely helpful.\n\nFinally, for the mobile-to-desktop users, I think an instant sync would be extremely helpful for everyone who's not on a Mac. Syncing what you have on mobile to desktop is a little difficult. If you could almost recreate that with your app I think it can be really helpful. The way I imagine it is I could voice-type something on my phone and then paste it on my laptop. This could be especially useful in situations where you can't verbally speak to your laptop out loud, but you can quietly whisper into the bottom of your phone.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or follow-ups, please feel free to reach out.",

            "body": "I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

Typing has always been one of those bottlenecks in my day, emails, proposals, notes, you name it. With Wispr Flow, that bottleneck is gone. It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool. It’s become a core part of how I work every single day, on my Apple mobile devices, my MacBook and my Desktop. If you’re serious about improving workflow and making better use of your time, it’s a no-brainer.",

The thing that did it for me was how it recognizes when I make a mistake and fixes it. Do any of the other alternative voice-to-text apps do that? And for those who've never tried Wispr Flow or don't understand what I'm talking about this is what I mean. \n\nWhen I use the apple built-in voice to text and said something like \"hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 4 PM no I'm sorry 3 PM at that new restaurant in downtown Indianapolis I'm sorry Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new talent bench\" It would type it out for word. \n\nHowever, when I use Wispr Flow and say the same thing, it would correct it to \"Hey Steve, let's meet tomorrow at 3PM at that new restaurant in downtown Baltimore and have lunch and discuss the new Talent Bench.\"\n\nI've tried Spokenly, the Apple Wispr app, and one other one that I can't remember, and none of them do that. Is there one that does? \n\nI am 99.9% happy with Wispr Flow. There was a bug like a month ago where it wouldn't catch the first or second word. But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me.

I saw the earlier fair‑warning thread on Wispr Flow and the stuff folks raised about big CPU usage, auto‑readding itself to login items and the privacy policy being a bit fuzzy. That’s actually why I ended up building [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) in the first place :-)\n\nOurs is \"hold‑to‑talk\": we only record while you hold a hotkey or mouse button. When you let go, the mic stops and there’s no hidden background process or browser plug‑in. The installer is about 100 MB and CPU usage stays near zero when idle. We also don’t store your audio or transcripts – they stay on your machine, we just stream audio for transcription and then it’s gone.\n\nThis isn’t meant to trash Wispr Flow – they’ve clearly been improving – but if anyone here is still looking for an alternative that’s lightweight and transparent, give [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) a look.

It only felt fair to give this update since I ripped into them last time around lol\n\nTL;DR, their explanations for the lapse in support seemed fair (caught them in the middle of a customer service transition) and the hiccups with the tool (they were blocked by a whole country lol). Also I didn't enjoy the other providers, they're just missing the oomph...\n\nSo basically, it seems like everything was going wrong for them at the same time for them. That's their explanation, at least which I kind of believe because some of the things seem to be consistent with what my friends were also experiencing. For example, apparently the UAE blocked their server or something, and no one in the country was able to log in, which was actually the root of my disdain. Also did not help that their support was not responsive, their explanation was they'd been changing up the customer service setup during this time. In any case, whether or not that's true, they've been super responsive of late and Im back to it being reliable.\n\nAlso, one last thing I wanted to say, which is also why I'm creating this post, is because what's kind of scary is that I tried all the other providers, and they do not come close to what Wispr Flow is offering. It's just little nuances are missed, it doesn't feel natural. It's scary because if they don't turn things around, Wispr Flow might literally be just monopolizing this whole sector. As it stands, it's pretty good, and my main gripes with them are resolved. So yeah I'm back to recommending them and everything's good again in the universe. ",

One thing I really liked about Willow, though, was its command mode. For example, if you started a dictation with “Hey Willow”, you could then say things like “Compose a message” or “Edit some other text”, and it would carry out those actions.\n\nA workflow I often used was dictating some text, then highlighting it and asking Willow to rewrite it — making it clearer, more formal, or more concise. That functionality was incredibly useful, and I’d love to know if anything like this is on the roadmap for Flow.\n\nI’ve logged well over 300,000 words on Flow so far, and I’d be happy to help beta test these kinds of features, or any other new capabilities you have in the pipeline.",

Keep up the great work.) when they hit about the 4-5 minute mark, sometimes those retrievals fail and I have to go to the app and then have to retry.

My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. \n\nSince switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application.

Right now, each device stores everything locally, and I think having our transcripts synced across all devices would be a game-changer.\n\n**Why this would be useful:**\n\n1. **Access history anywhere** - Being able to view and search through my transcription history on my phone, computer, or any device where I use Wispr Flow would be incredibly convenient.\n2. **Storage concerns** - Local storage is becoming a real issue. My phone already has over 1GB of documents just for the app, and I can’t even imagine how much my computer has accumulated. Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage.\n2. **Backup and peace of mind** - If something happens to one device, I wouldn’t lose all my transcription history.\n\nOf course, I understand this will be implemented as an optional feature that users can opt into if they’re comfortable sharing their transcription data and history with Wispr. That way, users who prioritize privacy can continue using local-only storage while those of us who want the convenience can take advantage of cloud sync.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experiencing similar storage issues or would find this useful!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

I like what the developer is doing but understand it is just him and I need more stability and reliability. I also find Wispr Flow's processing faster, which I enjoy. I may visit SuperWhisper again in the future. I definitely did like being able to create custom modes and select different models.",

So I just let it go. \n\nBut I saw an interview with the Founder/CEO on the Paperless Movement channel, which I just love. This guy really impressed me. \n\nI tried again today, and oh my goodness, am I ever glad I did. \n\nThis is a complete game changer for me. In fact, I am writing this post by whispering it because it's late, and it just works perfectly. Not one mistake. \n\nWhatever you guys did over the past few months has really brought this up to speed. I could not be happier. \n\nI'm using this across all three of my devices: my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. And it is just flawless. \n\nCould not recommend this enough! This gets my highest vote! ",

It's just so easy and it's so great at getting the spellings right, especially with unique names and so on.

Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling.

As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

            "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

However, when I dictate longer passages, Flow starts inserting blank lines between sentences. This is the case in every app. I'm writing an essay, and it's important that I stay in the same paragraph. My current workaround is to stop dictation after each sentence and start it again; it prevents the extra line, but it slows me down and breaks my rhythm. Is there a way to force continuous text in a single paragraph (i.e., never send Enter unless I explicitly press it)? Thanks! ",

Not only does it dictate what I say with amazing accuracy, but it also understands the tone of my voice and punctuates accordingly so that my tone is conveyed through what I intend to type. The fact that it captures everything that I whisper to it is just amazing. In addition, it does not have any problems with different dialects, whether English or any other language. This is great.",

Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have.

            "body": "Hey folks! 👋\n\nI've been testing **Wispr Flow** for a while now, and honestly, it's become part of my daily workflow. As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. \n\nThis app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived.

This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. \n\nThe simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing.

But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. \n\nThis app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived.

So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.\n\nWhen using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say.

However, when I dictate longer passages, Flow starts inserting blank lines between sentences.

My current workaround is to stop dictation after each sentence and start it again; it prevents the extra line, but it slows me down and breaks my rhythm.
