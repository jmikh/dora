How many hours did it take you to do it?\n\nYou can feel the Electron impact on performance with the GPU helper hitting for real, but tbh it does the job, and the depth of features is fairly good for a 0.1 (Dictionary, Parakeet support (why English only?), voice trigger, post‑process BYOK). \n\nI guess the challenge with building an Electron app is that anyone can vibe clone you very quickly (not saying this is what was done here, but the interface is very similar to another app ;).\n\nKeep up the good work, and try to remain safe because Bluetooth, system audio, Accessibility API and AI post‑processing are going to drive you crazy. :D\n\nAll the best\n\nOlivier",

I assume they use Whisper.cpp or Parakeet so in terms of transcription speed and accuracy it’s probably similar.\n\nFrom quickly looking at their feature lists we overlap on most core features. The main things that currently stand out in Vowen that I can say are:\n\n1. Generating summaries for ongoing Zoom or Google Meet calls by capturing audio + periodic screenshots  \n2. Voice triggered automations that launch apps/websites or sequences of actions. It's still in beta right now, but the idea is to be able to automate repetitive flows with this. \n\n\\----\n\nYes, it's an electron app. We are building this for fun on the side from our day job. The overhead of writing two different apps for different platforms is a lot of effort honestly 😅. So we decided to go with Electron. I know, it's not optimal in terms of the size, right now the DMG stands at \\~120mb.",

      "body": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nMy brother and I have been building a macOS app called Vowen. It is a speech to text and AI supported writing tool built on Whisper.cpp / Parakeet with optional support for local and cloud models. Everything can run locally and you only use the cloud if you choose to add your own API key.\n\n**Why we built it**\n\nBoth of us use AI tools constantly for coding, writing, planning and general problem solving. Over time it felt more natural to just speak instead of typing long prompts or explanations. We regularly dictate into Cursor and ChatGPT and that easily ends up being five to eight thousand words a week.\n\nWe originally used Whisper Flow and paid for the subscription because it worked well. Eventually we realized that with Whisper.cpp and lightweight models running locally we could have similar accuracy and speed directly on our own machines without depending on a service.\n\nSo we started building our own workflow tool, mostly because it made daily work easier and because we enjoy building it. Since it is powered by open source components and something we want to keep experimenting with, we decided to make it free forever.\n\n**What it does today**\n\nThe focus is on quickly getting ideas into tools you already use, not replacing deep writing. It helps with things like:\n\n• Dictating prompts into Cursor, ChatGPT or any other AI tools  \n• Writing messages and replies in Slack or Discord  \n• Drafting emails in Gmail  \n• Rewriting or shortening selected text  \n• Recording meetings and generating summaries  \n• Voice commands to open apps or trigger simple actions  \n• Using either local models or your own cloud API key\n\nIt is meant to reduce friction when moving from thought to action rather than replace long form writing tools.\n\n**Roadmap**\n\nWe are currently working on:\n\n• Support for Windows  \n• More voice driven workflows for interacting with apps\n\n**Feature requests**\n\nWe are actively building based on what users ask for. You can send suggestions here:\n\n[https://vowen.featurebase.app/](https://vowen.featurebase.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions and would love to hear how you would use a local voice interface in your workflow.",

This is one of those genuinely great apps that I discovered way back in June as well, and it has saved me so much time texting, emailing, and overall my productivity has skyrocketed as well. \n\nThe simple way of manually typing things out is slowly becoming old school and old fashion. The only reason why more people aren't doing it is because they find themselves in public places, especially in workplaces, and they probably feel it's very awkward to talk to their computer all day. \n\nHowever, with wispr flow, they really stepped up their game and implemented actual whispering into your microphone. and it's able to detect the words and sentences properly and with insane accuracy and precision all while whispering into your microphone so that you don't disturb your co-workers or colleagues. \n\nThis app is also definitely great for people that have disabilities or arthritis and they can use their hands as much when they're texting or typing. So this is definitely a game changer for those people as well.",

Helps a lot. Use my referral link, please! It would really help because then I can get more months. But it is genuinely such a time saver.  By the way, it only works on Windows, Mac, and iOS.

Like 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes. If i'm doing some light texting, i don't want it to turn off immediately, but i dont want it to wait a full 5 minutes either. I want it to be a minute or two, so that when i'm done texting it takes note and shuts off. might that be in the cards in the future?\n\nAlso, I've been waiting for over 30 days to get a response for an service issue ticket I submitted about Command Mode not working. Is nobody home?",

That setup gives the best results while we work on a proper fix. \n\nGoing forward we'd really appreciate if you also report these issues directly in the app (press Help in the bottom left corner), it'll be much easier for us to have context and follow up with you there when it's fixed!",

      "body": "I'm writing this post because I'm genuinely furious. I bought into the hype that Wispr Flow was the next big thing in dictation, especially for Mac users. What I got was a barely-disguised Electron app that runs like a pig. My M2 MacBook Pro, which normally handles my entire dev stack without breaking a sweat, starts spinning up the fans the second I launch this garbage.\n\nIt's supposed to be a seamless, system-wide tool, but it's constantly draining my battery and making my whole system lag. It's the antithesis of a native Mac app. The interface is clunky, the menus are slow, and the whole thing feels like a bad web wrapper. I've had better performance from free, open-source tools.\n\nIf you value your battery life and system performance, stay away from Wispr Flow. It's a prime example of lazy development being sold at a premium price.\n\nHas anyone else noticed how badly this app performs on modern macOS hardware?\n\n\n\n",

That can help keep formatting consistent.\n* Try toggling Smart Formatting off and on in Settings → System to see which mode behaves better for you. Just a heads-up that this changes how Flow processes your text.\n\nIf it’s still adding the space afterward and starting with lowercase, feel free to reach back out and let me know if it's a specific issue to the Click Up application, or is happening in others too.

This model is super fast and capable, in Superwhisper desktop I add this as a custom API endpoint.\n\nThe thing with Kimi K2 is that it likes to freestyle a bit with long content. So if I'm dictating something beyond a couple of minutes, I'll switch to a different mode using the same prompt with GPT-5. Most of the time for dictation transcriptions, I'm jumping between those two modes—GPT5 for for lengthy dictations, and Kimi K2 for quick communication.\n\nI do have some other prompts I use more for assistance or coding help, and for that I'll use Sonnet. But the other two are the ones I use most.\n\nUnfortunately on iOS we still don't have the ability to add custom AI models, so I just stick to GPT-5. I've seen that I also get pretty good results with GPT-4.1, but the difference in speed is almost negligible from what I've tested, so I just go with GPT-5. GPT 4.1 or GPT5 are actually very good at following instructions with complex requirements—much better than Sonnet or even Haiku.",

Spokenly is a solid alternative that can do a lot of what Wispr Flow does—free if you use local models or bring your own API keys. There's also Ito AI, which is basically an open-source copy of Wispr Flow (less powerful, but maybe you don't need \"powerful\" right now). If you need more power and customization there's VoiceInk, Superwhisper (my favorite), and a bunch more.\n\nHonestly, there are A LOT of alternatives.\n\nEDIT. BTW. If you are looking for something that is iOS as well, then your options will be a bit more limited. Wispr Flow/Spokenly/Superwhisper. Out of those three my fav on iOS is Spokenly, but Superwhisper has a new version on Testflight and it's really nice—not sure when will it be released. There's also VoiceInk for iOS but last I tried it was too buggy, perhaps it's better now.",

That will stop Flow from interpreting structured phrases like “write an email,” though it may also make formatting less natural in some cases. With Smart Formatting turned off, normal dictation will only record and transcribe. \n\nCan you also confirm whether you’re using [Command Mode](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/8476991260-command-mode) or just normal dictation? That helps us pinpoint what’s triggering the actions. \n\nAs for the Cyrillic text issue, Flow works best when dictating in a single language. Mixed text (like Cyrillic plus English) can cause encoding problems. For now, we suggest:\n\n* Keeping the original message with Cyrillic characters copied somewhere safe before dictating.\n* Avoid giving commands on Cyrillic text.\n* After dictation, paste the original Cyrillic text back in manually to preserve characters.\n\nThis should prevent further corruption while our team looks into improving how different text formats are handled.",

Flow pastes clean, unformatted text by default to ensure consistency across apps, which is why Gmail switches back to its default font. A simple workaround is to dictate in another app like Flow Notes, then copy and paste your text into Gmail and apply your preferred font once — that should keep things consistent.\n\nI’ll also share this with our product team to see if we can make Flow more flexible with fonts in the future.

      "body": "Hello\n\n1. Cyrillic text gets corrupted If the text contains Cyrillic  and I use Wispr Flow, the Cyrillic  text that was copied before starting the voice recording gets its Unicode changed and shows as random symbols. In short, Wispr Flow alters the original Unicode.\n2. I can’t fully disable commands I have commands disabled in Settings, but Wispr Flow still performs actions instead of only transcribing. For example, when I say “write an email with this and that,” it immediately applies changes. I want Wispr Flow to transcribe exactly what I say, with no extra actions. \n\nPlease advise how to:\n\n* Completely disable commands and any auto-actions so it only records and transcribes.\n* Fix or work around the Cyrillic Unicode corruption.\n\nThanks.",

      "body": "I like to use Flow to respond to and create emails, but it keeps changing the font part of the way through. Instead of Verdana (which is my default font in Gmail), it changes it to Sans Serif, which, of course, looks totally different. So then I have to highlight it and change it and it's a pain. I don't understand why it can't stick with the default. FWIW, I use MacOSTahoe (beta) and IOS 26.1 (beta).\n\nIs anyone else having this problem? ",

That said, Flow shouldn’t be using nearly that much when you’re not actively dictating because it’s not doing anything with the audio until you start talking.\n\nTotally get that it still feels higher than expected though, especially if it’s also preventing the screen from locking.

However, they also have great local models that you can use for 100% free. \n\nThey have parakeet models and whisper models which is the same one that chat GPT uses. So it's really nice. \n\nYou also have the option to bring your own API keys if you would like but me personally I've been using the local models for 100% free and it's been a game changer. It's currently available on Mac OS and iOS.",

While I don’t want to call it scientific, I’ll likely include some references on the website in the future. I’ve conducted a lot of studies to develop a workflow that could potentially help us procrastinate less (I admit, I procrastinate a lot!).\n\nThe application is still in beta, and I’m testing it thoroughly until I’m confident enough to say that it might actually be helpful.\n\nIf you’re interested in checking it out, you can find it at https://app.brains.so.

      "body": "Tried using Wispr Flow this week because honestly, I am desperate to find something that helps me stay productive without being glued to a screen all day. Between job hunting, interviews, and trying to juggle my kid’s schedule, I thought a voice-based tool would finally give me some breathing room. But omg. It keeps butchering what I say. It keeps mishearing things if there’s even a little background noise like I said AWS lambda logs and it typed “Alice’s lamb belongs.” I actually laughed the first time, but then I wanted to throw my phone away the fifth time. It also forgets context constantly, like if I pause for a second, it just loses the thread entirely. And the lag kills me. By the time it processes what I said, I could’ve just typed it myself. I want to love the idea like it’s everything I’ve dreamed of when I’m folding laundry or cooking dinner while thinking through code problems but it’s not there yet. It feels like it’s built for people sitting alone in silent offices, not actual humans with noise, kids, and chaos. I really really want this tech to work, I just wish it worked for the rest of us too.",

There's a free tier that gives 5k words per month if you just want to try it out: [https://dictaflow.vercel.app/](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) .

I wish Apple would not require app switching, but other than that it works wonders and it's very easy to use. You will not go wrong with this application. It makes working on your phone much faster. I can talk way faster than I can ever type on my phone. And Wispr Flow really captures the meaning of what I'm trying to say. I can talk in little segments, edit, and move my cursor around, and it will paste in whatever I transcribed into that section. It's lickety-split fast. It's the fastest transcription I have ever seen. I've used it for well over a year now, and I love it.",

Like it misses a lot of words and sentences. So I just use the built-in microphone on my laptop. And because of this, it makes working in public spaces, especially in a really loud environment, kind of challenging because the microphone is trying to pick up all the distracting noises in the background along with my voice so it sometimes misses a lot of key words or even sentences. \n\nSo I generally try and find a more quiet space and I speak at a more moderate volume.",

Command mode already takes an extra few seconds to do the AI processing, and I would love to see giving command mode access to some custom templates or formats that I can reference via voice commands when editing my text.",

In **messaging apps**, Flow made things a bit lighter and more casual.\n\nThat worked fine for most people, but it didn’t always reflect your personal writing style.\n\nNow with **Personalized Style**, you now decide how Flow formats your text based on the type of app, so you always sound like *you*.\n\nChoose your preferred formatting for each type of app:\n\n* **Personal messaging apps** (iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram)\n* **Work messaging apps** (Slack, Teams)\n* **Email apps** (Gmail, Outlook, Superhuman)\n* **Other apps** (Docs, Notes, ChatGPT, etc.)\n\nDepending on the app category, you’ll be able to choose from **Very Casual, Casual, Excited, or Formal.** Flow will automatically apply your chosen **punctuation** and **capitalization** whenever you dictate. However, your words stay yours: Flow won't alter your grammar, phrasing, or word choice. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyhuvcscr2yf1.png?width=1582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=183eceb3c7cc9f54d73793ed6d86e3465c7cc094\n\n**To try it out, open your Flow Desktop app and go to Style from your lefthand navigation.**\n\n**Note:** This feature is currently only available on Desktop, coming soon to iPhone. In the interim, there's a simpler version called **Casual tone while messaging** under **Settings → Personalization.**",

We automatically add them after longer pauses to make text easier to read and less like one big block of text. Most people find it helpful because it keeps everything clean and spaced out.\n\nThat said, I totally get how that would be frustrating in your case, especially if you’re dictating longer essays where everything needs to stay in one paragraph. There isn’t a way to customize this setting right now, and it’s probably not something we’ll be able to support immediately, but I’ll make sure to share this feedback with our team for future updates! \n\nThanks again for explaining your situation so clearly.",

I believe they have launched new AI offline models that provide much faster and more accurate output.\n\nAs we speak, I am trying both applications together — Wispr Flow and Super Whisper — and I find Super Whisper a tad faster with the current AI model that I'm using, and it is offline. I can use this anywhere, anytime without an internet connection. If you want a quick and accurate response, I suggest exploring the new offline AI models, which have about a 10/10 response time and around 8/10 accuracy. I am using the Parakeet English AI Model.",

But other than that, they fixed that., I've not had a single issue with it, and it works amazing, including the snippets and the dictionary as well. They just upgraded it to allow you to customize it to talk more casually via text message, and more formally via email or documents or whatever you choose depending on the platform you're talking. \n\nCorrecting my grammar, spelling, and mistakes like that is amazing to me. And that's why I was wondering if any of the other apps did it.",

      "body": "Hello Wispr Flow Support team,\n\nI’m seeing a consistent issue on the desktop app over the last day: recordings appear to continue in the UI, but the saved audio files stop at \\~00:31 and the transcripts are clipped mid-sentence. I would attach WAV/MP3 examples here, but this help window seems to only accept images, so I’m pasting representative transcript snippets below (unaltered).\n\n• App: Wispr Flow (desktop)\n\n• Device/OS: MacBook Pro (2024), macOS Sequoia 15.7.1\n\n•  Version 1.3.535 (1.3.535) - Pro account\n\n• Timeframe: \\~past 24–48 hours\n\n• Symptom: Recording indicator keeps running; downloaded files are exactly 31s; transcript truncates. \n\nSeparately, an older issue is still present: Command Mode never activates and always returns that servers are busy.\n\nCould you advise next steps? I also submitted this to \"Report an Issue\" in the app, but I don't know which space is more regularly monitored.  \n\n\nThanks for your time and guidance",

It’s optimized for shorter (think &lt;5 min) bursts of speech, like writing follow-ups, jotting down thoughts, or replying to messages. \n\nMeeting recorders work differently. They handle long, continuous audio streams with significant lag before you get a full transcript. Flow transcribes your words almost immediately, and in any text box where you type. \n\nSo we're less of a \"meeting recorder\" and more of a \"voice keyboard\" if that makes sense!",

Flow will automatically detect those, and they’ll keep working even with the lid closed. That should include most 2.4GHz or RF wireless lapel mics — they show up to macOS as a “wired” input, so you shouldn’t see the same Bluetooth issues.\n\nThanks again for calling this out! It’s a really helpful setup example, and we’ll make sure to include it in our help docs once we gather a few more confirmed working options. If you find a mic that performs especially well, definitely share it! I’m sure others would appreciate it too.",

      "body": "I love WisprFlow and subscribed immediately after seeing the potential for vibe coding, and sure enough, it has boosted my coding rates like 10x because I can now provide more ample context to Claude and its precision has increased like 100 times when solving coding problems, because I can now describe a complete scenario and AI takes it from there. So now instead of generating useless code, it can create precise code that solves the issue right at the first try 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, there's a big problem that I think Wispr Flow hasn't solved yet. I tried to use it with my AirPods, and them being Bluetooth, it doesn't understand anything I say at all. I have to revert back to using my laptop and speaking to the internal microphone. This is annoying because sometimes I need to use my monitors and put my Mac in clamshell mode. But putting it in clamshell mode makes the internal microphone not work properly and I'm being forced between using my monitors or WisprFlow.\n\nI was thinking about buying a wired USB-c lapel microphone, but all the cables are really long and quite cumbersome to be sitting down and getting my microphone on and off if I have to move from my desk to somewhere else. Then I saw a cheap wireless microphone that plugs into the USB port and the mic on my lapel.\n\nThis is no Bluetooth, seems to be RF and have much less delay than BT, will it work with Wispr Flow, or will it be a complete failure? Guess I will have to buy a couple of different microphones and see which one works. But should it forcefully be a wired microphone?\n\nI really love Wispr Flow out of all the dictation apps I tried. I am recommending it to all my friends and co-workers because this thing is making us go many times faster than just typing. AI gets really powerful when used with Wispr Flow because you are giving it way more context than simply typing stuff and it helps you solve problems right about 95% of the time as I said before. Also Wispr Flow is one of the few apps that really gets it right the first time you say it compared to others, (particularly Siri), that understand nothing at all or invent words you didn't even say.\n\nAny tips you have so I can use Wispr Flow with wireless microphones? Or a practical wired mic that you know works properly with my Mac in clamshell mode and dictating from about two feet away?\n\nI'll make some experiments and report back as soon as I find out what works...\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Cheap chinese wireless lapel mics with RF receiver worked great because they are RF and limited to bluetooth bandwidth, check my reply below for the links on the mics I did my experiment with.",

They are taking a free model that does nothing but speech to text and charging $15 a month for it. They are trying to fill in the gap that Apple has left with Siri and it will work for a little while until Apple either acquires them or improve Siri.\n\nIf the App actually did more than speech to text, I might be willing to pay them monthly. If it consistently worked, I might be willing to pay them. Between the app crashing or just refusing to work, it’s almost useless. \n\nWhen you charge more than dragon for your product and do so much less, I can see why they say we’re in AI bubble.\n\nI’ve run into nothing but app delays and typos or it just not working.

I have bigger hands, and as I'm getting older, over 55, it's harder to see the little phone and it's hard to type. So the fact that I can just say what I got to say and it transcribes it perfectly, saves me so much time, so much headache, and even better, so much missed messages.\n\nWhen using apps like email and messages. One of the other benefits I find is that one of the biggest pains in the butt of text messaging has to be the fact that messaging doesn't always have the right sense of feeling or emotion or whatever. So a lot of things can get miscommunicated or misconstrued. However, I feel like when you dictate, it does a better job of delivering what you're trying to say than what you really want to say. So you have less chance of having confusing messages.",

Why I turn Flow on from the in-app toggle:\nI have Wispr Flow set to immediately turn off after each message. That means I have to manually tap “Start Flow” every single time I want to speak, which quickly becomes annoying and time-consuming. Turning Flow on from the in-app toggle is my way of trying to keep it active so I don’t have to keep restarting it.\n\n2. What I want it to do:\nWhen I manually toggle Flow on, I expect it to stay active until I either turn it off myself or close the app — regardless of the “immediately turn off” setting. Essentially, the toggle should act as a manual override that keeps Flow running continuously.\n\nSo in short:\n\t•\tThe toggle should override the “immediate turn off” setting.\n\t•\tOnce turned on, Flow should stay active until I manually stop it.",

The toggle should always reflect the true mic status. We’ll make sure that gets fixed in an upcoming update.\n\nTo better understand the rest of your workflow (and make sure we’re improving the right thing), could you share a bit more context?\n\n* What’s your main reason for turning Flow on from the **in-app toggle** instead of the **keyboard mic**?\n* When you do that, are you usually trying to keep Flow running in the **background** (e.g., for longer dictation), or just to make it faster to re-activate?\n* How often do you use the “Immediately turn off” setting vs other timeouts?\n\nWe’re exploring whether the toggle should override that “immediate turn-off” behavior, or whether it makes more sense to clarify what it does in the UI. Your input will help!",

      "body": "**Issue Summary**\n\nWhen using the “immediately turn off Wispr Flow” setting, the in-app toggle button doesn’t function as expected as a persistent on/off switch.\n\n**Current Behavior**\n\nI have my app configured to “immediately turn off Wispr Flow” rather than using the 5-minute (or similar) timeout setting. This works correctly about 95% of the time.\n\nHowever, when I manually toggle Wispr Flow on in the app, it doesn’t stay on persistently. Instead, the first event that would normally trigger an immediate stop causes the microphone to turn off, even though I explicitly enabled it via the toggle.\n\nAdditionally, there appears to be a UI sync issue: when I return to the app after this happens, the toggle still shows as “on” even though the microphone is actually off (confirmed by the indicator in the top left of my screen). The toggle only updates to reflect the true state after I manually turn it off.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nWhen I toggle Wispr Flow on in the app, it should remain active until either:\n\n- I manually toggle it off, or\n- I swipe out of/close the app\n\nThe toggle should override the “immediately turn off” setting while it’s enabled, and the UI state should always accurately reflect whether the microphone is actually active.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Things like long-pressing to move the cursor vertically or using certain gestures are restricted by iOS, which made the experience feel clunky. That’s why we ended up focusing our current keyboard on quick punctuation and small edits. It’s optimized to switch seamlessly back to Apple’s for deeper edits.\n\nThat said, we do plan to bring back a complete Flow keyboard (letters, autocorrect, swipe typing, and more) at some point once we expand our iOS and ML engineering team. It’s not a trivial build given Apple’s sandbox restrictions, but it’s something we’re actively planning for.\n\nTotally hear the desire for an interim version without all the bells and whistles! We’ll keep that feedback in mind as we scope the next updates.",

But even though the dictation features on smartphones and computers have gotten very, very good, they're still full of typos, they lack context, and generally you sound kind of like an imbecile - especially with ChatGPT. It's amazing that it can even understand what I'm saying at all. \n\nThis app changes everything. It is context-aware. It capitalizes and adds punctuation properly. It automatically adds bullet points, lists, and paragraphs. Pair this with Raycast and the command feature, and you will barely have to type anymore. I imagine that for disabled and injured people, this is  life-changing. It is shockingly good. Not only that, but assuming a typical risk profile, privacy mode is more than sufficient to ensure that if you don't want your input permanently archived. I used this for 5 minutes before I was like, \"this is just going to be part of my life now. It's that good.\" You see what it did there? It added quotes automatically. Incredible.",

      "body": "Hey folks! 👋\n\nI've been testing **Wispr Flow** for a while now, and honestly, it's become part of my daily workflow. As someone who thinks faster than they type (and honestly, who doesn't?), this tool has been a huge productivity boost.\n\n**What I like about it:**\n\n* Voice-to-text that actually understands context – not just word-for-word transcription\n* Works seamlessly across all apps (emails, docs, code comments, messaging)\n* The formatting is surprisingly smart – punctuation, paragraphs, even technical terms\n* Great for brainstorming while walking or when you just need to get ideas out fast\n\n**Real talk though:** I know there's been some discussion about privacy concerns in the community. If you're working with sensitive data, definitely check their privacy policy and maybe stick to their privacy mode. For me, I use it for general productivity tasks where I'm already on public platforms anyway.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:** I've got an invite code that gives you **a free month of Wispr Flow Pro** (unlimited dictation). Figured some of you might want to test it out without committing to a subscription right away.\n\n👉 **Invite link:** [https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197](https://wisprflow.ai/r?FLORIAN197)\n\nIf you try it, I'd love to hear what you think! Also curious if anyone's found better alternatives – always down to test new tools.\n\nCheers! &amp; Ⓐhoi 🏴‍☠️",

Given the size of Wispr Flow and the amount of funding that they just raised, this should be implemented ASAP compared to Spokenly, which is run by one person. And he was able to add a keyboard on his own by himself without any funding. It's a single developer. So if he can do it, Wispr Flow should be able to do it in a couple of hours.",

      "body": "Thank you so much for getting back to me and starting the conversation. \n\n\n\nFirst of all, I think that it could be useful simply from a storage perspective. Storing everything locally adds up pretty quickly.\n\nSecondly, from a history perspective, I personally always go back to my history and either look at what I previously typed to remember what I was working on, or if I lose access to something or accidentally forget where and what I did with something that I typed. It makes it super easy just to go to my transcription history and see exactly what I typed. Thirdly, to be able to copy things that I said previously that I may want to say again without having to restate or rewrite them for memory.\n\nThird of all, I think this opens the door to more personalization. If you store the transcription history, you can use it as training data to make a more custom, fine-tuned model for each user. The transcription in AI Polish is more tailored towards their style, vocabulary, and preferences, making it a more magical experience for the user. I understand that all users may not want this, but for the ones that do, it could be good to have. \n\nAnd finally, yes, I would love to have the ability to search my old notes, maybe for the past week or month. I sometimes have a vague recollection of me previously writing something, and being able to go back and check would be extremely helpful.\n\nFinally, for the mobile-to-desktop users, I think an instant sync would be extremely helpful for everyone who's not on a Mac. Syncing what you have on mobile to desktop is a little difficult. If you could almost recreate that with your app I think it can be really helpful. The way I imagine it is I could voice-type something on my phone and then paste it on my laptop. This could be especially useful in situations where you can't verbally speak to your laptop out loud, but you can quietly whisper into the bottom of your phone.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or follow-ups, please feel free to reach out.",

But we haven’t prioritized cloud sync for full transcription history because most people use Flow as an interface to send text into their other apps, not as a place to store or search everything long-term. Once a dictation is sent to email, docs, or chat, that’s where it usually lives and stays searchable.\n\nWe’ve also found that this use case is pretty rare. In fact, a relatively small portion of our users is regularly activating on both desktop AND iOS, so there just isn't much demand for full cross-device history.\n\nThat said, it’s helpful to understand what you’d want to use it for. Are you mostly looking to revisit past transcriptions or reuse old notes? That kind of context helps us think about whether a lighter option, like selective sync or export, might make sense in the future.\n\nThanks again for starting the discussion!",

      "body": "Hey Wispr Flow team and community!\n\nI’d love to see cloud sync functionality added for our transcription history. Right now, each device stores everything locally, and I think having our transcripts synced across all devices would be a game-changer.\n\n**Why this would be useful:**\n\n1. **Access history anywhere** - Being able to view and search through my transcription history on my phone, computer, or any device where I use Wispr Flow would be incredibly convenient.\n2. **Storage concerns** - Local storage is becoming a real issue. My phone already has over 1GB of documents just for the app, and I can’t even imagine how much my computer has accumulated. Offloading this to the cloud would free up significant local storage.\n2. **Backup and peace of mind** - If something happens to one device, I wouldn’t lose all my transcription history.\n\nOf course, I understand this will be implemented as an optional feature that users can opt into if they’re comfortable sharing their transcription data and history with Wispr. That way, users who prioritize privacy can continue using local-only storage while those of us who want the convenience can take advantage of cloud sync.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experiencing similar storage issues or would find this useful!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "body": "I have the shortcut **Opt + W** configured, and it works fine. The problem is that when I try to use a third-party app that simulates keystrokes—like **Multitouch**, which lets me assign quick actions to the trackpad corners—it doesn’t work.\n\n**WisprFlow** is the only app with which I’m having this issue. Does anyone know why? I have about eight other shortcuts configured with different apps, and all of them work fine—except this one.\n\nHas anyone found a solution? Multitouch also allows running **bash commands**, in case WisprFlow supports that…\n\nI also tried setting up **Hands-Free Mode** in the same way, thinking maybe the issue was that the key needed to be held down rather than just tapped once, but that wasn’t the problem either.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oba871db9ivf1.png?width=2926&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ec13c529e4de9645762b81727d7b3a186eeb596\n\n",

Should I utilize the report feedback feature inside the Wispr Flow app, or is there an alternative channel for positive comments? Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to suggest a thumbs-up icon for specific transcripts as a feature request.\n\nThank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your guidance!\n\n\\-----  \n\\^ Written with command mode. :)\n\n(Edit: correction from \"posts\" to \"transcripts\". I mean to say that if I use command mode, and I really liked the outcome, then instead of using the report feedback flag, it would be cool if there were an icon simply with a thumbs up.)   \n",

Whether I’m in a quiet meeting, at the library, or just don’t want to disturb people around me, it works flawlessly.\nThe offline feature is brilliant too no internet? No problem! It saves the audio and transcribes it later, so I never lose my thoughts. For someone who’s been frustrated with Apple’s voice dictation for years, this app feels like magic.

That's why I built DictaFlow as a Windows‑only alternative. It only records while you hold down a hotkey (so there's no always‑on mic), doesn't add itself to login items, and the installer is \\~100 MB with near‑zero idle CPU. We don't store your audio or transcripts either — audio is sent for transcription and then discarded. It also adapts to different apps (IDEs, terminals, Outlook) and can paste or type into VDI/remote desktops. We have a free tier if you just want to try it. If you're curious, you can check it out here: [https://dictaflow.vercel.app/](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) . Happy to answer any questions or feedback (even if it's not for you).",

I saw the earlier fair‑warning thread on Wispr Flow and the stuff folks raised about big CPU usage, auto‑readding itself to login items and the privacy policy being a bit fuzzy. That’s actually why I ended up building [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) in the first place :-)\n\nOurs is \"hold‑to‑talk\": we only record while you hold a hotkey or mouse button. When you let go, the mic stops and there’s no hidden background process or browser plug‑in. The installer is about 100 MB and CPU usage stays near zero when idle. We also don’t store your audio or transcripts – they stay on your machine, we just stream audio for transcription and then it’s gone.\n\nThis isn’t meant to trash Wispr Flow – they’ve clearly been improving – but if anyone here is still looking for an alternative that’s lightweight and transparent, give [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/) a look. I’m a solo founder so all feedback is welcome (even if it’s \"your app sucks\"). [DictaFlow](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/)",

Wispr Flow seems to be one of the top for ease of use, but there are solid options on both sides and I think Flow is far from monopolizing the market. I personally prefer customization so simple options feel super limiting to me. \n\nOn the other hand all apps may have overlapping features but all of them seem to be missing one thing or another. I'd say there's still room for more/better options to pop up.",

      "body": "So here was my earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1ncpjhm/wispr_flow_has_turned_into_total_garbage_dumpster/) nearly a month ago and I have to say they've rebuilt and possibly surpassed the trust the I had with them earlier. It only felt fair to give this update since I ripped into them last time around lol\n\nTL;DR, their explanations for the lapse in support seemed fair (caught them in the middle of a customer service transition) and the hiccups with the tool (they were blocked by a whole country lol). Also I didn't enjoy the other providers, they're just missing the oomph...\n\nSo basically, it seems like everything was going wrong for them at the same time for them. That's their explanation, at least which I kind of believe because some of the things seem to be consistent with what my friends were also experiencing. For example, apparently the UAE blocked their server or something, and no one in the country was able to log in, which was actually the root of my disdain. Also did not help that their support was not responsive, their explanation was they'd been changing up the customer service setup during this time. In any case, whether or not that's true, they've been super responsive of late and Im back to it being reliable.\n\nAlso, one last thing I wanted to say, which is also why I'm creating this post, is because what's kind of scary is that I tried all the other providers, and they do not come close to what Wispr Flow is offering. It's just little nuances are missed, it doesn't feel natural. It's scary because if they don't turn things around, Wispr Flow might literally be just monopolizing this whole sector. As it stands, it's pretty good, and my main gripes with them are resolved. So yeah I'm back to recommending them and everything's good again in the universe. ",

      "body": "I’ve been using Wispr Flow for about six months. At first, everything was great, but lately the app’s performance on Windows has gotten much worse.\n\nThe biggest problem is that it often freezes, and when it does, it can also freeze whatever app I’m working in. At first, I thought it was the fault of the apps themselves (like having too many browser tabs open), but when Notepad++ started freezing too, it became really irritating.\n\nThis might be related to my use case - I use voice input together with editing and pasting new text. When I’m using Wispr Flow and paste from the clipboard with Ctrl+V, these freezes start happening. Sometimes the cursor even jumps around unexpectedly.\n\nI also use the Windows feature “Clipboard History” (Windows key + V) quite a lot. Another issue is that I often use voice input with languages that have non-Latin scripts, and Wispr Flow completely messes up the copied text in those languages. For example, it records the message I dictated \"I’m talking about Wispr Flow\", then copies the previous message \"Лісьце ў пушчы як цудоўны ложак\", but changes its encoding into something like \"Ë³ñüöå ¢ ïóø÷û ÿê öóäî¢íû ëîæàê\".\n\nThe encoding issue is annoying but tolerable. The freezes, however, are driving me crazy.\n\nHas anyone here used voice input apps for Windows that combine AI with speech recognition? I don’t need commands - just plain text dictation.",

Using it on my iPhone, it keeps on losing my transcription every time I do something long-form, especially when I'm using my AirPods. Perhaps this is a problem with AirPods, but truly I cannot keep on losing very important transcripts. I'm not always in a perfectly quiet environment. So if I'm just on the go or trying to send someone a message or trying to look up something really quickly, I can't always have 100% perfect silence.\n\nThis needs to be more robust to noise and work better with software/hardware such as AirPods, etc. It also needs to work for longer form content which is in particular an issue on the iOS app, not so much on Mac OS. I don't know if the issue is because after use it for a while it becomes slower because the required inference time or something is an issue. I don't know what it is. But this has truly had some issues with the long processing time, lost transcripts unable to work in not perfectly ideal environments, etc.",

How did an unstable version even end up on my PC? And most importantly, how can I install a stable version?\n\n\\---  \n  \nThanks for reaching out. My name is Tyler, your AI assistant, and I'm here to help.  \nCommand Mode isn’t working in your Wispr Flow desktop app (version 1.3.454 on darwin/arm64) likely because of:  \n\n\n* **Version Stability:** Version 1.3.454 isn’t a stable release. The stable version is 1.3.424. Using an unstable version can cause issues.\n* **Command Mode Changes:** Command Mode is being updated and may not work reliably right now.\n* **Hotkey Conflicts:** The default shortcut (Fn + Cmd) might clash with system settings or your keyboard. You can change this in Settings → Hotkeys.\n\n**What to do next:**  \n\n\n1. Switch to the stable version (1.3.424): click the Wispr Flow icon in the menu bar → \"Flow version\" → install the update.\n2. Check your subscription is Flow Pro or higher, since Command Mode requires it.\n3. Change the Command Mode shortcut to a less common combo (like Fn + Shift + P) in Settings → Hotkeys.\n4. Avoid starting dictation with phrases like \"Hey, Flow,\" which can trigger Command Mode by mistake.\n5. Quit and restart the app after these changes.\n\nIf this doesn’t fix the issue, it may be due to Command Mode’s experimental status. Please report it using the app’s \"Report an issue\" option in the Flow Hub (under the ? icon).  \n  \nBest,  \nTyler  \nWispr Flow AI Support Agent",

      "body": "Does Wispr Flow have an API like Deepgram does? I love Voice AI top 2% of Flow users for the past several months. \n\nHence, I am building a voice AI management companion to help individuals become the best versions of themselves. I started with using chat GPT's Whisper - 1 model. This was a disaster. \n\nI then one day had an idea and epiphany really to start relying on Wispr Flow entirely. My team supported my frenzy and changed the UI and UX overnight. This was an awesome decision. Soon after we quickly realized that we could have used existing speech-to-text models such as 11labs, Assembly, and Deepgram. We chose Deepgram because a trusted friend recommended it and we got into Deepgram's startup program. It's a free API. \n\nSince switching to Deepgram we have definitely improved accuracy, our user intent understanding, and creating voice shortcuts - somewhat adjacent to Wispr Flow. However, Wispr Flow's sole focus on speech-to-text makes them insanely good at it and I would love to just pay/partner with Wispr Flow for the API and use them in built into my app. It would really unleash the power of my application. So does Wispr Flow have an API similar to Deepgram or OpenAI? ",

Even when I disable Smart Formatting, the text is not transcribed word-for-word as I dictate it; instead, an AI alters it. This is noticeable because the app is no longer as fast as when AI Formatting is disabled. There is a noticeable delay caused by AI Formatting. This delay is another factor that makes the application unattractive. Because of the forced delay introduced by the AI Formatting, the app is now sometimes even slower than other speech-to-text applications, particularly those using the Groq API.",

When I first got Wisprflow, I thought it was awesome, but it's just gotten so bad recently. has anyone felt the same??\n\nThe app constantly glitches. One minute it works, the next it freezes or disconnects for no reason. I've had it randomly stop during important notes, and sometimes it says it can't connect even though my WiFi is fine.\n\nAlso, it seems to be a really clunky electron app. It's always taking up a massive chunk of my computer's memory and slows everything down. It's extremely resource-intensive, especially given the fact that it's always going to be on in the background.\n\nI've requested for support like a million times, but no one ever responds. I've given up on the product for the past couple of weeks. Recently, I've been looking and exploring some new ones.\n\nI still really like the idea behind it, so I’m looking for something that actually works. Here are some better options I’ve found. When researching these, I specifically only looked for the ones that were built natively for Mac:\n\n**Voice Ink**: Fantastic for people who want control and power-mode switching. One-time payment, local models, and a solid dev support.\n\n**Super whisper**: Best for power users who want full control and unlimited AI processing. Also one-time payment, with local models.\n\n**Willow Voice**: The devs here are amazing. They respond in minutes and fix things quickly. Mac native app. It’s subscription-based, which I don’t love, but it’s the fastest and most accurate dictation tool I’ve used. Formatting for emails is spot on, which I haven’t seen from the others.\n",

I've been using it for a few days now (partway through the 2-week trial) and was absolutely loving the product - was 100% going to sign up for Pro. But this morning it just won't auto-paste text into any apps.\n\nThe transcription itself works fine, but instead of pasting automatically, I now get a banner saying \"Click a text box and use Alt+Shift+Z to paste.\" Alt+Shift+Z does nothing. I've tried:\n\n* Right-click → \"Paste last transcript\" - nothing\n* Changing the keyboard shortcuts to something else - nothing\n* Uninstalling the application completely\n* Uninstalling then deleting all the Wispr folders I could find, then reinstalling\n* Testing in Chrome, Notepad, Word, Discord - won't paste into any of them\n\nThe only way I can use it now is to go into the actual Flow app and manually copy the text, then paste it where I want it, which completely defeats the purpose.\n\nI've checked for Windows updates - there were none last night or this morning when I turned on my machine. I just can't get my head around what could be causing this. It was literally working perfectly when I shut down last night.\n\nUsing Windows 11. Anyone else had this issue?

As mentioned in a previous post, even the basic switch between two languages (French/English) has significant challenges. When you push the button to dictate in French and then stop, push again to switch to English, there are still many recognition problems with your tool. (it translate in french in place of english)\n\nIt's t the international level that you face the most significant challenges, but this also presents an opportunity to differentiate yourself from competitors if you are able to fix this main issue. \n\nAn alternative solution we've discussed involves using one different shortcut per language.",

      "body": "👋 I’m Sahaj Garg, CTO of Wispr Flow. \n\nBuilding Wispr Flow has been the most fun (and humbling) engineering challenge of my career. Voice feels magical when it works instantly, but making it reliable at scale means solving a lot of problems that are still unsolved in the field.\n\nHere are some of the biggest ones we’re working on:\n\n* **Latency:** People won’t wait. We have \\~700ms to get from speech → formatted text, even on bad Wi-Fi. Anything slower feels broken.\n* **Ambiguous audio:** A short clip could mean ten different things without context. (If you want to see some examples that show the audio clip, raw transcription, desired transcription, and key challenges explained, [check out this blog post here](https://wisprflow.ai/post/speech-recognition-challenges).)\n* **Learning from corrections:** If you fix Flow once, it should never repeat the mistake. The hard part is capturing the edits, determining which edits should be repeated (and in what contexts to apply them), and then training an LLM to precisely follow those edits.\n* **Whisper mode:** People want to use Flow in offices, trains, and libraries. Making automatic speech recognition (ASR) work when you’re basically mumbling into your mic is its own frontier.\n* **Multilingual code-switching:** Around the world, people mix languages in the same sentence. Most ASR models collapse here, but successfully solving it unlocks global voice.\n* **Scale:** Users already dictate over a billion words a month. That number is about to 10x, and latency still has to stay flat.\n\nThat all said, these problems are what make this field exciting. If you want to learn more, you can [check out the full blog post here](https://wisprflow.ai/post/technical-challenges). \n\nAnd if working on them sounds fun to you, [we’re hiring!](https://wisprflow.ai/careers)",

      "body": "Hey u/Numerous_Spread_4866, CTO of Wispr here. I want to clarify a few things:\n\n**On the “screenshots/data leak” claim:**\n\nEarly beta builds had a context awareness feature that also used screenshots (with explicit permission during onboarding) to help with recognizing names. It never stored data, and we removed the screenshot feature before our ProductHunt launch.\n\nWe later rewrote the app from the ground up to avoid that confusion. To be clear: we have never collected or stored user data without consent.\n\nTo make this even more explicit, you can also toggle Privacy Mode for zero data retention, and we’re now SOC 2 + HIPAA compliant. Our goal here is to be as transparent as possible and give users control.\n\n**On the Slack community:**\n\nWe unfortunately had to make the tough decision to shut down the slack community because it had grown larger than we could support without a dedicated community manager. We made the tough call that this was better than leaving the community without responses. Once we're able to hire a dedicated community manager, we'll reopen a Slack or Discord, and in the meantime we created this reddit group as a community.\n\n**On “shilling”:**\n\nSome early posts came from a contractor. I’m not a regular Reddit user, and I regret letting that happen. Going forward, everything official comes from clearly labeled Wispr accounts.\n\nI know trust isn’t rebuilt overnight, but I wanted to share context from our side.",

I tried resetting the keyboard shortcuts to their defaults, but it's still not working. I tried the command + fn key, the control+fn key, and control+option+C, and none of them are working.\n\nI toggled off the accessibility for permissions for Wispr Flow and system preferences, then toggled it back on. I restarted my machine, and still, I am not able to get command mode to function.\n\nPlease advise another step or steps that I can take to try to troubleshoot this. I would love to be able to utilize this feature. I'm on a Mac, obviously. :)\n\nThank you!",

      "body": "Hey u/goldfinch424,   \nFlow tries to make its best guess at where sentences should break, which can get tricky in spots like your example. If there isn’t a clear pause in the audio, the model sometimes has to “choose” whether to end a sentence or keep it going. In your case, it possibly assumed you wanted a longer sentence, even though the more natural reading would’ve been a new one.\n\nA couple things that can help in the meantime:\n\n* **Pausing slightly longer between sentences** gives Flow a stronger signal to break.\n* **Reporting in-app (like you’ve been doing)** is super valuable! These examples get reviewed and directly help us improve.\n\nWe’re always tuning the balance here, because different people prefer sentence structure and length. Posts like this help us understand where the current defaults feel off. Thanks for flagging it!",

      "body": "u/VictoriaAtWispr, I appreciate your reply!\n\nI understand that you want to use Reddit to gain more visibility. However, in my view, it’s the wrong approach to prioritize promotion over user intention. The goal should be to make it as easy as possible for users to provide feedback and suggest improvements. A great product generates visibility on its own — satisfied users will happily share their experiences.\n\nRemember your customer: The perfect tool should save time and effort. We are highly efficient people who want to save time and work as effectively as possible in general. Having to create a Reddit account just to give feedback on another tool and searching for subreddits, while reading each one to find the one with the same intent, feels like an unnecessary hurdle. I am absolutely against the idea of using Wispr in this manner.\n\nIn the end, this unfortunately comes across as yet another unconventional path Wispr is taking — one that risks slowing things down rather than accelerating growth. On top of that, Reddit offers weaker structure and discoverability for such matters (which might be a reason tools like Canny exist). There’s no roadmap transparency, and if activity really does scale, things will quickly become completely unmanageable.\n\nI use Wispr because it's really fast, but other tools are emerging quickly, and they have features I absolutely miss in Wispr. I hope you will be ahead in that race.",

This ENTIRE incident was meant to be a coverup for the fact that they were completely insecure and leaking user data.

Also, the app signifies in the floating island that the microphone is always being used even when the keyboard is not actively on. This has interference with Hey Siri which is annoying.

It feels effortless now to get thoughts out quickly and clearly, and that’s translated into more productivity across the board.\n\nWhat stands out most is how natural it feels to use. There’s no learning curve, no clunky setup, it just works the way you want it to. We’ve seen a measurable boost in efficiency as a team because less time is wasted on the mechanics of typing and more time goes into actual thinking, communicating, and executing.\n\nFor me, Wispr Flow isn’t just another tool. It’s become a core part of how I work every single day, on my Apple mobile devices, my MacBook and my Desktop.

The only recommendation I can make for the team is to update the Wispr Flow keyboard UI to be up-to-date with the new iOS 26 keyboard because Apple changed the look of the keyboard.

One thing I really liked about Willow, though, was its command mode. For example, if you started a dictation with “Hey Willow”, you could then say things like “Compose a message” or “Edit some other text”, and it would carry out those actions.\n\nA workflow I often used was dictating some text, then highlighting it and asking Willow to rewrite it — making it clearer, more formal, or more concise. That functionality was incredibly useful, and I’d love to know if anything like this is on the roadmap for Flow.\n\nI’ve logged well over 300,000 words on Flow so far, and I’d be happy to help beta test these kinds of features, or any other new capabilities you have in the pipeline.",

Technically, iOS does allow us to do this, but the trade-off is that once the other audio is paused, it stays paused until you completely stop Flow, not just while you’re actively dictating.\n\nWe experimented with this in the past, but it didn’t create a good experience (for example, music/podcasts wouldn’t resume naturally). That’s why it’s not implemented today.\n\nThat said, we know this is a pain point and we may revisit it in the future if we can find a smoother way to handle audio interruptions. Thanks for surfacing this. Feedback like yours helps us weigh what to prioritize!",

In Cursor and Windsurf, you can even tag files. \n* [Snippets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WisprFlow/comments/1nimgwg/lpt_tired_of_retyping_the_same_things_try/): You can create custom voice shortcuts for things like booking links or outreach templates instead of typing them over and over. \n\n**And as someone who's been around since the early days, I'd love to hear any feedback you might have on how we can make both our product and our community better!**",

You just select the one you want, and it inserts it in line. Bonus points if you can organize them by folders or tags or something. \n\nI know that this is kind of beyond the scope of Wispr Flow because it's a voice app, but it would make it so much easier to recall and bring up different snippets. \n\nOne common use case that I have is not just for coaching links, but for example, I answer a lot of people's questions online, and many times the answer to a question involves a link to one of my YouTube videos. So I have to go now and look up the video, copy the share link, and then paste it in my response. It would be amazing if I could simply say \"my video on such-and-such topic\" and it brings up that URL automatically. \n\nMaybe I am going into rag territory here. This is one idea that I mentioned to you on Twitter a while ago. For example, when I mention in my speech something about coaching link or whatever, something that might match one of my snippets, at the end of dictation it would pop up a menu with suggested snippets to include based on the keywords that I mentioned.",

Submitting a quick in-app report when this happens is super helpful because it lets us pull the logs and see exactly what went wrong.\n\nThe good news is that improving the reliability and user experience for longer dictations is already on our roadmap, and the team is actively looking into it. \n\n  \nThanks again for surfacing this and being such a dedicated user. Feedback like this helps us prioritize!",

You say a cue, and Flow instantly drops in the full block of text, whether it’s a scheduling link, AI prompt, email template, or code block. \n\nHere are some creative ways we’ve seen people use Snippets: \n\n🌱 **Everyday life:** \n\n* Scheduling emails: \n   * Snippet: “schedule reply”\n   * *“Great to meet you!

Provide me a list of no more than 10 bullet points with key updates, risks, and next steps. For each person I need to follow up with, draft a follow-up note to them.”* \n* Company address:\n   * Snippet: “office address” \n   * *“Wispr Flow, 444 Townsend Street, FL 1, San Francisco, CA 94107”* \n\n**🚀 Founders** \n\n* Elevator pitch: \n   * Snippet: “short pitch” \n   * *“Wispr Flow is smart voice-to-text that helps you work 4x faster in any app, with voice commands, context recognition, and automatic editing + formatting.*\n* Hiring: \n   * Snippet: “hiring” \n   * “Wispr Flow just raised a $30M Series A from Menlo Ventures and is hiring across the board: marketing, engineering, data, support and ops. Check out [https://wisprflow.ai/careers](https://wisprflow.ai/careers) for our full list of openings.” \n\n🧑‍💻 **Developers**\n\n* Staging link: \n   * Snippet: staging link \n   * “*Staging link: https://staging.example.com”*\n* Onboarding instructions\n   * Snippet: “use local backend” \n   * *“run local backend → docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build”*\n\n⚖️ **Lawyers** \n\n* NDA Clause \n   * Snippet: NDA clause\n   * *“This Agreement is entered into as of \\[Date\\] between \\[Company\\] and \\[Recipient\\], and covers all confidential information disclosed…”*\n* Confidentiality reminder\n   * Snippet: Confidentiality\n   * *“This communication may contain privileged information. If you are not the intended recipient, please delete immediately.”*\n\n🤝 **Teams** (you can share snippets across your team!) \n\n* Support responses\n   * Snippet: Support response\n   * *“The best way to report an issue is by flagging it in the app. That way, we will already have your device, software version, and user logs so that we can start diagnosing your issue immediately. ”*  \n* Business policies \n   * Snippet: expense policy\n   * “*Please submit all receipts within 30 days using Expensify. All expenses over $100 require a receipt. Travel expenses require manager approval.”*\n\nThe magic of snippets is that you only need to write it once. After that, just say the word! \n\nShare your favorite use case for snippets in the comments. ⬇️",

      "body": "Sadly unreliable\n\nAlthough the technology itself is very accurate as far as the speech to text portion of it, there's just way too many bugs regarding it Not actually typing where you selected at all. So if you're interested in constantly having to open an interface to copy the last paragraph of text from your last conversation so you can copy it and then paste it where it where it should have gone then go right ahead and knock yourself out. The built in speech to text that's in Windows is much more reliable in this regard and it works in real time so if it's not recognizing your text area or theres a mic glitch you at least you'll be able to tell before you go on and on speaking entire paragraphs to then find out it wasn't listening all along or it had no idea where you wanted that text to go. I'll revisit this software in 6 months to a year when they work out all of these kinks and hopefully they'll get that flushed out.",

Our iOS app is newer than desktop, and we’re actively working to smooth out these rough edges\n\n**On the default keyboard issue:**\n\nYou’re right — third-party keyboards like Flow, Grammarly, or Gboard can’t override Apple’s default behavior. Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard yet; it’s optimized for quick capture with the mic and number pad, then hands you back to Apple’s keyboard for autocorrect and swipe typing. That said, building a full letter keyboard *is* on our roadmap once our iOS/ML team grows. (And if you know great engineers: we’re hiring 😉).\n\n→ Full article here: [Default Keyboard Not Sticking](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/8540739176-default-keyboard-not-sticking)\n\n\n\n**On the mic resetting when you switch devices:**\n\nThis comes down to iOS privacy rules. Apple doesn’t let third-party keyboards auto-re-grant mic access when headphones or input devices change, so Flow needs you to reopen the app. The best workaround we’ve found is setting up a dictation shortcut mapped to your Action Button or Back Tap. That way you can toggle Flow without switching apps.\n\n→ Full article here: [Microphone Keeps Resetting](https://docs.wisprflow.ai/articles/6847370892-microphone-keeps-resetting)",

It feels clunky. From what I understand, it might be because Wispr Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard—it only has a number pad and a mic button. But if that’s the case… why not just make it a full keyboard? Spokenly, for example, doesn’t run into this exact issue (though it has other problems, like being unusable in Safari and some native iOS apps).\n2. **Background permissions** Another hurdle is that I need to constantly jump back into the app to re-enable mic access, especially when switching input devices (like putting on headphones). This breaks the flow and makes quick capture harder than it should be.\n\nThese don’t *seem* like unsolvable problems, so I’m wondering—am I missing something here? ",

I asked GPT about it, and it said maybe the reason is that Wispr Flow isn’t a “full” keyboard—it only has a number pad and a voice input button. If that’s the case, why not just make it a full keyboard? I don’t get it. For comparison, Spokenly’s iOS version doesn’t have this problem (though it has another one: you can’t even select it in Safari and some native iOS apps).\n\nThe second issue is background permissions. I have to constantly jump back into the app to re-enable mic access, especially when I change input devices (like when I put on headphones).\n\nTo me, these seem like problems that should be relatively easy to solve. Why aren’t they? Has anyone else run into this?",

On the computer it's hard to tell whether the dictation is on or not so I have often dictated for a while only to realize that all of the work was not recorded. 4.

      "body": "Hey everyone, I’m **Victoria, Product Marketing Lead at Wispr Flow**.\n\nWe know many of you have likely seen a Reddit post from a year ago, right after launch when the product was buggy, privacy/security info was unclear, and our “marketing” was a scrappy contractor who did things we don’t stand by. \n\nSince then, we’ve overhauled security (SOC 2, HIPAA, Privacy Mode), fixed the system issues, and built a full-time marketing team committed to authentic, two-way dialogue on this subreddit. \n\n**Privacy &amp; Security**\n\n* **SOC 2 Type II** compliance for Enterprise plans, **HIPAA** compliance available on all plans, and **ISO 27001 coming soon!** \n* **Privacy Mode:** You can turn this on at any time if you go to your app &gt; Settings &gt;  Data and Privacy. It will trigger Zero Data Retention, meaning no audio or transcripts are stored. If you turn it off, dictations *may* be used to improve our features, but it’s never sold or shared. \n* **No third-party sharing:** Dictation data is never sold or shared with third parties. Period.\n* **Data is encrypted** in transit/at rest, and never shared with third parties.\n\n**Product Fixes**\n\n* **Auto-login bug fixed:** Wispr no longer re-adds itself to login items if you turn it off.\n* **Browser integrations clarified:** Wispr doesn’t inject into Chrome/Firefox or any app anymore. \n* **Performance optimized:** We’ve slimmed down the app and reduced idle resource usage significantly.\n* **Context awareness:** Flow uses nearby text in your active app to improve transcription accuracy (like in the case of an uncommonly spelled name.) You can turn this off at any time if you go to Settings &gt; Data &amp; Privacy &gt; Context Awareness.\n\n**Community &amp; Transparency**\n\n* **Slack removal:** It was wrong to remove someone from our Slack community for raising concerns. We know there’s room to improve, and we *want* to hear it. To keep things organized and make sure nothing gets lost, we’ll host a pinned Feedback Thread every month where you can share this. But if you have a big idea or detailed critique, feel free to spin it out into its own post too.\n* **Astroturfing/shills:** We know there were posts that looked like fake promotions. Those came from a contractor before our marketing team even existed. We’ve since removed that contractor and committed this community to authenticity. Everything coming from Wispr employees will be clearly indicated as such with user flair. \n* **Moving forward:** This subreddit is our home for **transparent, two-way dialogue**. No bots. No shills. Just real conversations with real people.\n\nWe don’t expect trust back overnight. But we’re here to earn it back through open conversation.\n\n– Victoria (Product Marketing Lead @ Wispr Flow)",

      "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m Victoria with Wispr Flow. We make voice-to-text that’s fast, accurate, secure, and works on all your apps (Gmail, Slack, ChatGPT, Notion, Cursor). We want to remove the hassle of typing so you can answer emails, write detailed AI prompts, or brain dump ideas as naturally as talking to a friend. \n\nI started this subreddit because I wanted to create a space where Flow isn’t just “our product,” but something we build alongside the people who rely on it every day. Think of this as a two-way dialogue: we’ll share what we’re building, and you’ll share what’s working, what’s broken, and what you wish existed. \n\nHere’s some of what you’ll see here:\n\n* Product updates (the good stuff, not just marketing fluff) \n* Guides &amp; workflow breakdowns (for coding, journaling, PRDs, brain-dumps, you name it)\n* Security deep dives (what Zero Data Retention, SOC 2, and HIPAA actually mean for you)\n* Feature request threads (where your voice actually matters) \n* Community productivity challenges (with cool prizes!) \n* Job postings (we’re hiring across engineering, marketing, recruiting, and design) \n\nWe’re rooting for your success with Flow and hopefully, you’ll root for ours too. But more than that: help us make this space useful for you!\n\nExcited to get this rolling with you all!\n\n– Victoria, Product Marketing Lead at Wispr \n\n",

I can't even use it in some basic text-based note-taking apps, which is the only reason that I wanted to use Wispr Flow. Also, it doesn't show live dictation as you're speaking. Only after you're done speaking, so I might as well just record a voice memo in the native iOS app and use the auto-transcription feature. The only thing I wanted Wispr Flow for was improving the quality of live dictation.",

That’s great fine love it. It’s a bit overpriced for that. Actually kind of a lot overpriced for that but the free tier is fine.   \n\nUnfortunately, there is a significant issue. Because of the way that Apple’s API for keyboards works…. (I assume it’s apple‘s fault… But not sure) the iPhone may sleep the app you have open or even lock the screen while you were dictating because you were not touching the phone.    \n\nFrustrating otherwise it would be worth it just for the custom dictionary alone… I am a writer, and there are a lot of names in my stories that are not spelled normally or are weird and some fashion, and adding them to the dictionary, makes this work nearly perfectly. \n\nBut I stopped using it after about 20 tries because on three occasions it lost the entire section. I dictated due to the app falling asleep because of inactivity while I was dictating. I think there is a way to let it continue to listen, but I think going into the sleep transition would break it anyway maybe I’m wrong. \n\nI look forward to a response from the developers… They have a good thing going here..",

I can speak naturally—no slowing down or over-enunciating—and it picks up everything, including punctuation and tone, almost flawlessly.\n\nThe convenience is unmatched. Whether I’m walking, driving, or juggling tasks, I can dictate notes, emails, or full documents on the go. It feels like having a personal assistant in my pocket.\n\nI’d love to see continued improvements in functionality, like deeper app integrations and smarter context handling. I also appreciate the focus on privacy and hope they keep strengthening those settings as the platform grows.\n\nIf you rely on dictation for productivity or creativity, Wispr Flow is a must-have.

It understands the nuance of what I’m trying to say and doesn’t do annoying random punctuation or use proper nouns from my contacts list.

      "body": "Issues with Messaging Integration, Activation Delay, and macOS Installation\n\nDescription:\nYesterday, the app worked seamlessly with text messaging. Today, it no longer functions directly in that context. The underlying algorithm is performing very well, and—unlike Apple’s built-in voice dictation (which has consistently been unusable due to poor transcription quality)—Wispr Flow delivers accurate, coherent dictation.\n\nHowever, Wispr Flow does not integrate seamlessly with text messaging. To use it there, I must manually activate it, and it appears to take a noticeable amount of time before it becomes functional. This delay makes quick messaging impractical. Currently, the only reliable workflow is to dictate within the Wispr Flow app, save the note, and then copy and paste the text into a message.\n\nAdditionally, I cannot install the macOS version. The website keeps looping between the “Download” and “Get Started” pages, preventing installation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tAttempt to use Wispr Flow dictation directly in text messages.\n\t2.\tObserve that it requires manual activation and delays before working, if it begins at all.\n\t3.\tAttempt to download the macOS app.\n\t4.\tNote that the site repeatedly redirects between “Download” and “Get Started.”\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow should operate seamlessly and activate instantly within text messages, as it did yesterday.\n\t•\tmacOS installation should complete without redirect loops.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\t•\tWispr Flow dictation in text messages requires manual activation and suffers from delays—often it doesn’t start at all.\n\t•\tThe macOS download page loops indefinitely between “Download” and “Get Started,” preventing installation.\n\nEnvironment:\n\t•\tiOS version: 18.1 (latest)\n\t•\tmacOS version: macOS Sonoma 14.6.1 (latest)\n\t•\tWispr Flow app version: 1.14 (released August 13, 2025)  ￼\n\nRequest:\nPlease advise on resolving:\n\t•\tThe messaging integration issue, specifically the delayed or non-functioning activation.\n\t•\tThe macOS installation problem due to the redirect loop.",

      "body": "Here’s a tool I use for coding. Usually, I work with it in the Claude Codes interface. I can set it up to automatically switch to this SuperWhisper mode whenever I open my Terminal Warp. Below are my custom instructions.\n\n    You are a transcription tool. Output exactly what the user says in Traditional Chinese.  \n    Do not rewrite, translate, interpret, or reply.\n    \n    Language and formatting rules:\n    \n    - Output should be in Traditional Chinese as spoken, preserving original input including English words, programming keywords, filenames, paths, and package names\n    - Preserve original casing and formatting of English words; fixed acronyms like API, CPU, GCP must remain uppercase\n    - When Chinese is adjacent to English words or numbers, insert one half-width space in between, except inside code blocks\n    \n    Inline code detection and wrapping (with backticks `):\n    \n    Wrap with ` if any of the following conditions are met and the token is clearly technical:\n    \n    1. File names or paths that contain `.`, `/`, or `\\` (e.g., `.env.local`, `index.tsx`, `/usr/local/bin`)\n    2. Variable, function, or constant names using one of these conventions:\n       - camelCase (e.g., `getUserData`)\n       - snake_case (e.g., `db_connect`)\n       - kebab-case (e.g., `tailwind-config`)\n       - PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`)\n    3. Terminal commands, package names, or module imports (e.g., `npm i next`, `brew install postgres`, `import { useEffect } from 'react'`)\n    \n    Multiline code blocks:\n    \n    - If 3 or more lines of code appear consecutively, wrap them using triple backticks ```\n    - If the language can be inferred (e.g., TypeScript, Python, Shell), append the language name right after the opening backticks (e.g., ```ts)\n    \n    Disambiguation rules:\n    \n    - Apply wrapping only if the word is clearly a technical item such as a variable, function, file, path, command, or package\n    - Do NOT wrap words that match the naming conventions but are actually brand names, people names, adjectives, or product names (e.g., ChatGPT, Mistral, NextEra)\n    \n    Layout and formatting:\n    \n    - Line breaks: insert a new line before semantic shifts or bullet points; otherwise, aim for 3–5 sentences per paragraph, with one blank line between paragraphs\n    - Punctuation:\n      - Use half-width punctuation for English: . , ; ?\n      - All paired symbols should be fully closed: “” () []\n    - List format: use `-` or `number.` to start each line; do not end lines with punctuation\n    - Ending symbols: use `?` for questions and `.` for complete statements; omit punctuation for fragments\n\nSome of these are for replying to emails. So, when I open Gmail in my browser, it automatically switches to Gmail Mode, which is pretty convenient.\n\nBecause of the layout, it's hard for me to share all the Custom Instructions with you right now. Hopefully, we’ll get more chances to chat and exchange tips in the future.",

      "body": "I’ve used Wispr Flow, Aqua Voice, and SuperWhisper. Wispr Flow has the most bugs, so I don’t like it and haven’t subscribed. Aqua Voice was the first service I subscribed to; its response time is relatively fast at around 400 ms. Its Custom Instructions and Dictionary features are well designed, though Custom Instructions still have some bugs and the Dictionary recognition is occasionally imprecise. Overall, I’d give Aqua Voice a score of about 80.\n\nI recently subscribed to SuperWhisper, which also has a few minor issues. However, because it lets me choose different models, its recognition accuracy is higher. It likewise offers Custom Instructions and a Dictionary, and both are more accurate than those in Aqua Voice. The downside is speed—SuperWhisper’s responses are roughly twice as slow, at about 800 ms.\n\nOverall, even though the slower response time is a drawback, I now use SuperWhisper more often. When I dictate detailed content, accuracy matters more to me than speed.\n\nOne feature I really like is SuperWhisper’s ability to switch between different modes. Whether I’m replying to emails, talking with Claude Code, or chatting with GPT, it can automatically choose the appropriate mode. Thanks to my custom instructions, I can tailor both input and output behaviors, which has greatly improved its usability.",

So I thought I'd write this post about my experience with Wispr Flow and Aqua.\n\nI've been trying both Wispr Flow and Aqua right now for speech-to-text. And interestingly enough, this entire post has been written with Wispr. I started with Wispr first and have been using it for about a month now, and I've been using Aqua for about a week. I have Wispr and Aqua mapped to two different hotkeys on my keyboard so I can easily test the two.\n\n**My Wispr Flow Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* iOS keyboard available – the only one of the two with a native iPhone/iPad option.\n* Usage stats – tracks words spoken and “time saved,” which I like sharing with friends.\n* Fairly accurate\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Not great for texting. Doesn't understand when to put in exclamation points or question marks. All my texts sound a lot colder than I am in real life, even in \"casual voice\".\n* Slightly laggy, has been slower than Aqua in every test.\n* Often misses the first word of a sentence.\n* Privacy policy doesn’t spell out data handling clearly.\n\n**My Aqua Voice Review**\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Faster transcription! Text appears almost instantly.\n* Much more natural sounding on text. I made a custom prompt for iMessage and Instagram so I sound a lot more like myself on messaging apps. \n\n**Cons**\n\n* No iOS app. desktop-only for now.\n* Same first-word bug as Wispr.\n* Privacy policy is still vague... needs more transparency.\n\nHope this is helpful! Have you tried either of these tools?",

This does not render non-English words well, even giving it context, clues, so I guess I’m gonna stick with talking to a large language model instead.

I know you're trying to make it more than a keyboard app, but literally just market to your super consumers. You're a keyboard app that has perfected speech-to-text. It is the best speech-to-text app and keyboard on the App Store by far. We don't need notifications, we don't need marketing emails - like you built a really, really great app, focus on that. Don't annoy your customers with emails and notifications that they don't want because it's just annoying and it really takes away from the great app that you guys built.\n\nIf the purpose of the notifications and email marketing is to drive people to purchase the pro version, just stop. Charge people $3 for the app - one-time purchase, unlimited use. This is the best keyboard app on the market, but you're annoying your customers with all of the notifications and the emails. And you could definitely charge people for this app, and I guarantee you, people will pay money for it. It is that good. But you need to seriously shift your strategy because you're not going to make money selling this pro notes feature. It's just not going to happen for you guys. You built a really great keyboard app, congratulations. Charge people $2, $3, even $5 for it because I guarantee you, word of mouth is going to get around and this app is going to blow up, and you're going to have no one pay for the pro version, and you're going to be stuck with this huge AI bill. If you just charge people a small amount of money up front for unlimited use, you're going to be fine. Please heed my advice.",

What you are going to find, surprisingly, is it's just a really new way to interact with your iOS device, because you'll find yourself just speaking to your phone through this keyboard.\n\nNot only is it faster (saving you time), but it really understands the context of where you're speaking to through your keyboard, whether that's over a text or a message or Instagram or an email or journaling. It's just so easy and it's so great at getting the spellings right, especially with unique names and so on. You could spell it out and it won't transcribe it word-for-word, but it will get the context and just update it.\n\nSo long story short, this is more of a ghostwriter disguised as an AI product.",

Many times I have to open the program so I can copy and paste what I dictate into the program I am using. I can type faster, which is more reliable than this program. Today I downloaded the app onto my iPad. I tried using it in Firefox, and the results were not good. It's easier and more reliable to use the iPad built-in microphone rather than using Wispr! 😟",

More polished. Better performance. Consistently faster and more accurate.\n\nThese are the competitors I'm comparing it to when I say Wispr Flow is the best:\n- superwhisper (second best)\n- MacWhisper\n- VoiceInk\n- Willow AI\n- BetterDictation\n- Whisperboard\n- Letterly\n\nEven if you could theoretically type faster than you could talk (not true for most people), I would still say it's better to use Wispr Flow because talking is LESS FRICTION. You can THINK more clearly written you're speaking naturally than you can when you're typing, especially on a tiny virtual phone keyboard.\n\nDownload it for your phone, and then go install it on your laptop.
