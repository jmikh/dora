    "reviewDescription": "Discounts - I logged into Grammarly and tried the beginning of a practice test.  I was unable to get back to it, and it won't let me retake the \"free\" test.  That is not my problem.  I subsequently received an email offering a discount for my first month.  I was unable to find the discount code, and following the link I was provided led me to a cart that only offered the full price. It included a place for a coupon code, but since I was unable to find one, I was unable to utilize the discount.  I have contacted customer service, but after sending a screenshot of the email, I received no response. I also sent a follow-up email.  I had a week off at the beginning of the month to study for a test to obtain my teaching license this fall, but I should have taken it already.  I wish I could pay full price, but I am unable to at this time.  I was supposed to receive a grant, and that also did not come through.  It would be nice if they honored their own advertisements.  I also found the first month free offer, which I was told was only offered in the form of a refund if you were not satisfied.  Seems very deceptive.  I think they know what they are doing.",

I thanked them and waited a few days for my refund, then i sent another email since i still hadn’t received it and they said they’d forward my request so i get it faster.

    "reviewDescription": "Updated\nI enrolled in Study.com believing the subscription included everything needed to finish my courses. However, one of my classes suddenly required an unexpected third-party paid platform that was not listed anywhere in the syllabus or terms of service. I only discovered the charge after clicking into the assignment.\n\nWhen I contacted support, an agent named Stacey R. admitted the issue and promised I’d be exempt from the extra fee, saying they’d clarify this for future students. That exemption was never honored.\n\nAfter that, communication became almost nonexistent. They promise a two-day turnaround on responses, but most of my cases went unanswered for a week or longer — and even when I did get replies, many weren’t properly addressed or resolved. Some tickets are still partially unanswered weeks later.\n\nI was also soft-locked out of assignments, received auto-generated rejection emails claiming “missing key portions,” and even watched human-graded submissions get marked “incomplete” within minutes — proving they were never actually read.\n\nWhen the issue was finally adjusted, they did fix the correct class — but they also interfered with another course I was still working on, marking it as failed in the process. My grades were not calculated correctly, and one assignment still shows as pending despite all work being finished.\n\nOn top of that, I can’t save updates to my account because their system flags my legal last name as profanity, which I verified with my driver’s license. Support acknowledged it but never resolved it.\n\nOverall, I’ve dealt with hidden fees, broken grading, poor communication, and unkept promises. I’m still waiting on multiple unresolved tickets and BBB responses.\n\nThis company is a complete joke. I will never do business with them again, and anyone considering Study.com should proceed with extreme caution.\n\nUpdated\nThe problem was acknowledged and I have been refunded which makes me in a better mood but does not change my overall opinion\n",

    "reviewDescription": "I have never had such a frustrating and dishonest experience with an online education platform. My subscription ended on June 19, but I had submitted all my assignments well before that date. The moment my subscription ended, I was hit with false accusations designed to force me into resubscribing just to resubmit the very same work I had already completed.\n\nI fought tooth and nail to get my assignments graded without giving them more money. They eventually marked them, but then refused to release my final grade. It is now August 13 and I have still received no response. Because of this deliberate delay, I missed both my July and August deadlines to transfer my courses to WGU.\n\nTheir so-called “support” is a joke. They have no phone support whatsoever and their email support is nonexistent, sometimes taking three weeks to respond, sometimes never. I have sent multiple emails with no reply.\n\nStudy.com’s business practices are predatory and unethical. They hold your work hostage to squeeze more money from you and they clearly do not care about your academic goals. If you value your time, money, and sanity, stay far away from Study.com.",

So you gonna end up paying $990 just to get one course out!!! Trust me they knew how to get your money well!  So if you doit do it in your own risk! JUST TO LET ANYONE KNOW THE TRUTH BEHIND STUDY.COM\n\n\nThey hire professionals so they need your money to pay them either way they well find a way!! I finish my classes month ago but ti need to keep subscription 3 times to just wait for them to grade and transfer and see the whole grade.. ",

    "reviewDescription": "The classes are good. The service is AWFUL. There is no way to speak with an actual human unless you call them out on social media, leave multiple voicemails to their direct-to-voicemail support line, and send multiple support tickets and emails, and threaten with a BBB complaint\n\nExample 1 - I finished a course and was locked out of the final exam. They incorrectly input my assignment scores (50/50, 71/75, 67/75) as percentages: 50%, 71% and 67% respectively. It took 8 DAYS of the above tactics to finally get someone to tell me “oh it’s a backend issue, and there is no final exam” despite the course clearly listing a final exam\n\nExample 2:\nMy transfer credit deadline was June 3rd. I completed everything by June 2nd. Grading at study.com has never taken more than a few hours at most, usually assignment grades take less than an hour or two to get back. I finished a course and was graded on assignments 1 & 3 within minutes. Waited until past my deadline for assignment 2 to be graded and it still hasn’t been. I even reuploaded assignment 3 with assignment 2 attached, and a txt file titled “URGENT ASSIGNMENT 2 STILL HAS NOT BEEN GRADED”, and they regraded my assignment 3 literally minutes later without touching assignment 2\n\nI am now past my transfer credit deadline while having paid their monthly fee three times (as well as multiple extra exams for $70 each) with nothing other than another automated response. I’ve looped in my college, and will be filing a BBB complaint and refund from my credit card for failure to deliver service",

They can take up to two weeks to grade your assignments and it could take up to three weeks for them just to have your transcript ready. But if you have any concerns or questions, it is really hard to get those answered because there is no customer service. No live representative. You can talk to. Yes there is a customer service phone number online but when you call, it’s just for you to leave a voice message. Nothing more.",

I also appreciate how user-friendly the platform is, and the practice quizzes have been invaluable in helping me feel confident before exams.\n\nTheir customer service is top-notch as well. Any time I’ve had a question, they’ve responded quickly and with helpful solutions. Overall, Study.com has been an affordable and effective way for me to earn credits and stay on track with my goals. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a flexible and supportive learning platform!",

When I checked again, the offer was special, and instead of $30, they gave you a week of nonsense for $5.95. And, to make it worse, they had nothing, just one offer of some blah blah they put together as 16 chapters, 262 lessons, and only 6 of these chapters had videos of 2-4 minutes of cartoons talking. You will get two hundred sixty-two silly lessons free of Google. I will dispute the charges with PayPal with all proofs of nonsense.  \n",

    "reviewDescription": "For the last several years I've reached out to Study.com demonstrating that there are real errors in their proctored exams. And to this day, those questions have not been corrected. Also, I would recommend students to avoid any course that requires submitted assignments that use subjective grading rather than objective grading. The former is where one's assignment is based on a reviewer's opinion rather than say (3+5=8). Unfortunately, all too often in academia a person's demographic is taken into consideration with grading. All things being equal, if your name is John Anderson and another student is Jawakatima Johnson, John will automatically earn a grade lower than Jawakatima. \n\nThe other thing that must be noted is that Study.com pays people for their positive reviews on Trustpilot and BBB through their Ambassador program.
